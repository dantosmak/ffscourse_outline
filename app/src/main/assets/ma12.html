<p id="d0512am-p3">The Lord Jesus gives special revelations of himself to his people. Even if Scripture did not declare this, there are many of the children of God who could testify the truth of it from their own experience. They have had manifestations of their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in a peculiar manner, such as no mere reading or hearing could afford. In the biographies of eminent saints, you will find many instances recorded in which Jesus has been pleased, in a very special manner to speak to their souls, and to unfold the wonders of his person; yea, so have their souls been steeped in happiness that they have thought themselves to be in heaven, whereas they were not there, though they were well nigh on the threshold of it—for when Jesus manifests himself to his people, it is heaven on earth; it is paradise in embryo; it is bliss begun. Especial manifestations of Christ exercise a holy influence on the believer&rsquo;s heart. One effect will be <em>humility</em>. If a man says, &ldquo;I have had such-and-such spiritual communications, I am a great man,&rdquo; he has never had any communion with Jesus at all; for &ldquo;God hath respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth <em>afar off</em>.&rdquo; He does not need to come near them to know them, and will never give them any visits of love. Another effect will be <em>happiness</em>; for in God&rsquo;s presence there are pleasures for evermore. <em>Holiness</em> will be sure to follow. A man who has no holiness has never had this manifestation. Some men profess a great deal; but we must not believe any one unless we see that his deeds answer to what he says. &ldquo;Be not deceived; God is not mocked.&rdquo; He will not bestow his favours upon the wicked: for while he will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he respect an evil doer. Thus there will be three effects of nearness to Jesus—humility, happiness, and holiness. May God give them to thee, Christian!</p>

<p id="d0512pm-p3">Jacob must have shuddered at the thought of leaving the land of his father&rsquo;s sojourning, and dwelling among heathen strangers. It was<em>a new scene, and likely to be a trying </em><em>one</em>: who shall venture among couriers of a foreign monarch without anxiety? Yet the way was<em>evidently appointed</em> for him, and therefore he resolved to go. This is frequently the position of believers now—they are called to perils and temptations altogether untried: at such seasons <em>let them </em><em>imitate Jacob&rsquo;s example</em> by offering sacrifices of prayer unto God, and seeking his direction; let them not take a step until they have waited upon the Lord for his blessing: then they <em>will have Jacob&rsquo;s companion</em> to be their friend and helper. How blessed to feel assured that the Lord is with us in all our ways, and condescends to go down into our humiliations and banishments with us! Even beyond the ocean our Father&rsquo;s love beams like the sun in its strength. We cannot hesitate to go where Jehovah promises his presence; even the valley of deathshade grows bright with the radiance of this assurance. Marching onwards with faith in their God, believers <em>shall have </em><em>Jacob&rsquo;s promise</em>. They shall be brought up again, whether it be from the troubles of life or the chambers of death. Jacob&rsquo;s seed came out of Egypt in due time, and so shall all the faithful pass unscathed through the tribulation of life, and the terror of death. Let us <em>exercise Jacob&rsquo;s confidence. &ldquo;Fear </em><em>not</em>,&rdquo; is the Lord&rsquo;s command and his divine encouragement to those who at his bidding are launching upon new seas; the divine presence and preservation forbid so much as one unbelieving fear. Without our God we should fear to move; but when he bids us to, it would be dangerous to tarry. Reader, go forward, and fear not.</p>
