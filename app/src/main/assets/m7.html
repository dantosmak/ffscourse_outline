<p id="d0307am-p3">Faith is the foot of the soul by which it can march along the road of the commandments. Love can make the feet move more swiftly; but faith is the foot which carries the soul. Faith is the oil enabling the wheels of holy devotion and of earnest piety to move well; and without faith the wheels are taken from the chariot, and we drag heavily. With faith I can do all things; without faith I shall neither have the inclination nor the power to do anything in the service of God. If you would find the men who serve God the best, you must look for the men of the most faith. Little faith will save a man, but little faith cannot do great things for God. Poor Little-faith could not have fought &ldquo;Apollyon;&rdquo; it needed &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; to do that. Poor Little-faith could not have slain &ldquo;Giant Despair;&rdquo; it required &ldquo;Great-heart's&rdquo; arm to knock that monster down. Little faith will go to heaven most certainly, but it often has to hide itself in a nut-shell, and it frequently loses all but its jewels. Little-faith says, &ldquo;It is a rough road, beset with sharp thorns, and full of dangers; I am afraid to go;&rdquo; but Great-faith remembers the promise, &ldquo;Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; as thy days, so shall thy strength be:&rdquo; and so she boldly ventures. Little-faith stands desponding, mingling her tears with the flood; but Great-faith sings, &ldquo;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee:&rdquo; and she fords the stream at once. Would you be comfortable and happy? Would you enjoy religion? Would you have the religion of cheerfulness and not that of gloom? Then &ldquo;have faith in God.&rdquo; If you love darkness, and are satisfied to dwell in gloom and misery, then be content with little faith; but if you love the sunshine, and would sing songs of rejoicing, covet earnestly this best gift, &ldquo;great faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0307pm-p3">Doubtless the reader has been tried with the temptation to rely upon the things which are seen, instead of resting alone upon the invisible God. Christians often look to man for help and counsel, and mar the noble simplicity of their reliance upon their God. Does this evening&rsquo;s portion meet the eye of a child of God anxious about temporals, then would we reason with him awhile. You trust in Jesus, and only in Jesus, for your salvation, then why are you troubled? &ldquo;<em>Because of my greatÂ </em><em>care</em>.&rdquo; Is it not written, &ldquo;Cast thy burden upon the Lord&rdquo;? &ldquo;Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication make known your wants unto God.&rdquo; Cannot you trust God for temporals? &ldquo;<em>Ah! I wish I could</em>.&rdquo; If you cannot trust God for temporals, how dare you trust him for spirituals? Can you trust him for your soul&rsquo;s redemption, and not rely upon him for a few lesser mercies? Is not God enough for thy need, or is his all-sufficiency too narrow for thy wants? Dost thou want another eye beside that of him who sees every secret thing? Is his heart faint? Is his arm weary? If so, seek another God; but if he be infinite, omnipotent, faithful, true, and all-wise, why gaddest thou abroad so much to seek another confidence? Why dost thou rake the earth to find another foundation, when this is strong enough to bear all the weight which thou canst ever build thereon? Christian, mix not only thy wine with water, do not alloy thy gold of faith with the dross of human confidence. Wait thou only upon God, and let thine expectation be from him. Covet not Jonah&rsquo;s gourd, but rest in Jonah&rsquo;s God. Let the sandy foundations of terrestrial trust be the choice of fools, but do thou, like one who foresees the storm, build for thyself an abiding place upon the Rock of Ages.</p>
