<p id="d0217am-p3">Hagar had once found deliverance there and Ishmael had drank from the water so graciously revealed by the God who liveth and seeth the sons of men; but this was a merely casual visit, such as worldlings pay to the Lord in times of need, when it serves their turn. They cry to him in trouble, but forsake him in prosperity. Isaac <em>dwelt</em> there, and made the well of the living and all-seeing God his constant source of supply. The usual tenor of a man&rsquo;s life, the <em>dwelling</em> of his soul, is the true test of his state. Perhaps the providential visitation experienced by Hagar struck Isaac&rsquo;s mind, and led him to revere the place; its mystical name endeared it to him; his frequent musings by its brim at eventide made him familiar with the well; his meeting Rebecca there had made his spirit feel at home near the spot; but best of all, the fact that he there enjoyed fellowship with the living God, had made him select that hallowed ground for his dwelling. Let us learn to live in the presence of the living God; let us pray the Holy Spirit that this day, and every other day, we may feel, &ldquo;Thou God seest me.&rdquo; May the Lord Jehovah be as a well to us, delightful, comforting, unfailing, springing up unto eternal life. The bottle of the creature cracks and dries up, but the well of the Creator never fails; happy is he who dwells at the well, and so has abundant and constant supplies near at hand. The Lord has been a sure helper to others: his name is Shaddai, God All-sufficient; our hearts have often had most delightful intercourse with him; through him our soul has found her glorious Husband, the Lord Jesus; and in him this day we live, and move, and have our being; let us, then, dwell in closest fellowship with him. Glorious Lord, constrain us that we may never leave thee, but dwell by the well of the living God.</p>

<p id="d0217pm-p3">Edom&rsquo;s princes saw the whole country left desolate, and counted upon its easy conquest; but there was one great difficulty in their way—quite unknown to them—&ldquo;<em>The Lord was there;</em>&rdquo; and in his presence lay the special security of the chosen land. Whatever may be the machinations and devices of the enemies of God&rsquo;s people, there is still the same effectual barrier to thwart their design. The saints are God&rsquo;s heritage, and he is in the midst of them, and will protect his own. What comfort this assurance yields us in our troubles and spiritual conflicts! We are constantly opposed, and yet perpetually preserved! How often Satan shoots his arrows against our <em>faith</em>, but our faith defies the power of hell&rsquo;s fiery darts; they are not only turned aside, but they are quenched upon its shield, for &ldquo;the Lord is there.&rdquo; <em>Our good works</em> are the subjects of Satan&rsquo;s attacks. A saint never yet had a virtue or a grace which was not the target for hellish bullets: whether it was hope bright and sparkling, or love warm and fervent, or patience all-enduring, or zeal flaming like coals of fire, the old enemy of everything that is good has tried to destroy it. The only reason why anything virtuous or lovely survives in us is this, &ldquo;the Lord is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="d0217pm-p4">If the Lord be with us through life, we need not fear for our dying confidence; for <em>when we come to die</em>, we shall find that &ldquo;the Lord is<em>there</em>;&rdquo; where the billows are most tempestuous, and the water is most chill, we shall feel the bottom, and know that it is good: our feet shall stand upon the Rock of Ages when time is passing away. Beloved, from the first of a Christian&rsquo;s life to the last, the only reason why he does not perish is because &ldquo;<em>the Lord is there</em>.&rdquo; When the God of everlasting love shall change and leave his elect to perish, then may the Church of God be destroyed; but not till then, because it is written, <span id="d0217pm-p4.1">Jehovah Shammah</span>, &ldquo;<em>The Lord is there</em>.&rdquo;</p>
