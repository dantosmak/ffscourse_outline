<p id="d0509am-p3">All the goodness of the past, the present, and the future, Christ bestows upon his people. In the mysterious ages of the past the Lord Jesus was his Father&rsquo;s first elect, and in his <em>election</em> he gave us an interest, for we were chosen in him from before the foundation of the world. He had from all eternity the prerogatives of <em>Sonship</em>, as his Father&rsquo;s only-begotten and well-beloved Son, and he has, in the riches of his grace, by adoption and regeneration, elevated us to sonship also, so that to us he has given &ldquo;power to become the sons of God.&rdquo; The<em>eternal covenant</em>, based upon suretiship and confirmed by oath, is ours, for our strong consolation and security. In the <em>everlasting settlements of predestinating </em><em>wisdom</em> and omnipotent decree, the eye of the Lord Jesus was ever fixed on us; and we may rest assured that in the whole roll of destiny there is not a line which militates against the interests of his redeemed. The <em>great betrothal</em> of the Prince of Glory is ours, for it is to us that he is affianced, as the sacred nuptials shall ere long declare to an assembled universe. The <em>marvellous incarnation</em> of the God of heaven, with all the amazing condescension and humiliation which attended it, is ours. The bloody sweat, the scourge, the cross, are ours forever. Whatever blissful consequences flow from <em>perfect </em><em>obedience, finished atonement, resurrection, ascension, or </em><em>intercession</em>, all are ours by his own gift. Upon his breastplate he is now bearing our names; and in his authoritative pleadings at the throne he remembers our persons and pleads our cause. His <em>dominion</em> over principalities and powers, and his absolute majesty in heaven, he employs for the benefit of them who trust in him. His high estate is as much at our service as was his condition of abasement. He who gave himself for us in the depths of woe and death, doth not withdraw the grant now that he is enthroned in the highest heavens.</p>

<p id="d0509pm-p3">The church was about to engage in earnest labour, and desired her Lord&rsquo;s company in it. She does not say, &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; but &ldquo;let us go.&rdquo; It is blessed working when Jesus is at our side! It is the business of God&rsquo;s people to be trimmers of God&rsquo;s vines. Like our first parents, we are put into the garden of the Lord for usefulness; let us therefore go forth into the field. Observe that the church, when she is in her right mind, in all her many labours desires to enjoy communion with Christ. Some imagine that they cannot serve Christ actively, and yet have fellowship with him: they are mistaken. Doubtless it is very easy to fritter away our inward life in outward exercises, and come to complain with the spouse, &ldquo;They made me keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept;&rdquo; but there is no reason why this should be the case except our own folly and neglect. Certain is it that a professor may do nothing, and yet grow quite as lifeless in spiritual things as those who are most busy. Mary was not praised for sitting still; but for her <em>sitting at Jesus&rsquo; feet</em>. Even so, Christians are not to be praised for neglecting duties under the pretence of having secret fellowship with Jesus: it is not sitting, but sitting at Jesus&rsquo; feet which is commendable. Do not think that activity is in itself an evil: it is a great blessing, and a means of grace to us. Paul called it a grace given to him to be allowed to preach; and every form of Christian service may become a personal blessing to those engaged in it. Those who have most fellowship with Christ are not recluses or hermits, who have much time to spare, but indefatigable labourers who are toiling for Jesus, and who, in their toil, have him side by side with them, so that they are workers together with God. Let us remember then, in anything we have to do for Jesus, that we can do it, and should do it in close communion with him.</p>
