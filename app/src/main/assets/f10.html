<p id="d0210am-p3">There are many who know &ldquo;how to be abased&rdquo; who have not learned &ldquo;how to abound.&rdquo; When they are set upon the top of a pinnacle their heads grow dizzy, and they are ready to fall. The Christian far oftener disgraces his profession in prosperity than in adversity. It is a dangerous thing to be prosperous. The crucible of adversity is a less severe trial to the Christian than the refining pot of prosperity. Oh, what leanness of soul and neglect of spiritual things have been brought on through the very mercies and bounties of God! Yet this is not a matter of necessity, for the apostle tells us that he knew how to abound. When he had much he knew how to use it. Abundant grace enabled him to bear abundant prosperity. When he had a full sail he was loaded with much ballast, and so floated safely. It needs more than human skill to carry the brimming cup of mortal joy with a steady hand, yet Paul had learned that skill, for he declares, &ldquo;In all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry.&rdquo; It is a divine lesson to know how to be full, for the Israelites were full once, but while the flesh was yet in their mouth, the wrath of God came upon them. Many have asked for mercies that they might satisfy their own hearts&rsquo; lust. Fulness of bread has often made fulness of blood, and that has brought on wantonness of spirit. When we have much of God&rsquo;s providential mercies, it often happens that we have but little of God&rsquo;s grace, and little gratitude for the bounties we have received. We are full and we forget God: satisfied with earth, we are content to do without heaven. Rest assured it is harder to know how to be full than it is to know how to be hungry—so desperate is the tendency of human nature to pride and forgetfulness of God. Take care that you ask in your prayers that God would teach you &ldquo;how to be full.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0210pm-p3">Attentively observe <span id="d0210pm-p3.1">the instructive similitude</span>: our sins are like a <em>cloud</em>. As clouds are of many shapes and shades, so are our transgressions. As clouds obscure the light of the sun, and darken the landscape beneath, so do our sins hide from us the light of Jehovah&rsquo;s face, and cause us to sit in the shadow of death. They are earth-born things, and rise from the miry places of our nature; and when so collected that their measure is full, they threaten us with storm and tempest. Alas! that, unlike clouds, our sins yield us no genial showers, but rather threaten to deluge us with a fiery flood of destruction. O ye black clouds of sin, how can it be fair weather with our souls while ye remain?</p>
<p id="d0210pm-p4">Let our joyful eye dwell upon <span id="d0210pm-p4.1">the notable act</span> of divine mercy—&ldquo;blotting out.&rdquo; God himself appears upon the scene, and in divine benignity, instead of manifesting his anger, reveals his grace: he at once and forever effectually removes the mischief, not by blowing away the cloud, but by blotting it out from existence once for all. Against the justified man no sin remains, the great transaction of the cross has eternally removed his transgressions from him. On Calvary&rsquo;s summit the great deed, by which the sin of all the chosen was forever put away, was completely and effectually performed.</p>
<p id="d0210pm-p5">Practically let us obey <span id="d0210pm-p5.1">the gracious command</span>, &ldquo;<em>return unto </em><em>me</em>.&rdquo; Why should pardoned sinners live at a distance from their God? If we have been forgiven all our sins, let no legal fear withhold us from the boldest access to our Lord. Let backslidings be bemoaned, but let us not persevere in them. To the greatest possible nearness of communion with the Lord, let us, in the power of the Holy Spirit, strive mightily to return. O Lord, this night restore us!</p>
