<p id="d0305am-p3">There are many ways of promoting Christian wakefulness. Among the rest, let me strongly advise Christians to converse together concerning the ways of the Lord. Christian and Hopeful, as they journeyed towards the Celestial City, said to themselves, &ldquo;To prevent drowsiness in this place, let us fall into good discourse.&rdquo; Christian enquired, &ldquo;Brother, where shall we begin?&rdquo; And Hopeful answered, &ldquo;Where God began with us.&rdquo; Then Christian sang this song—</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p id="d0305am-p3.2">&ldquo;When saints do sleepy grow, let them come hither,</p>
        <p id="d0305am-p3.3">And hear how these two pilgrims talk together;</p>
        <p id="d0305am-p3.4">Yea, let them learn of them, in any wise,</p>
        <p id="d0305am-p3.5">Thus to keep open their drowsy slumb'ring eyes.</p>
        <p id="d0305am-p3.6">Saints&rsquo; fellowship, if it be managed well,</p>
        <p id="d0305am-p3.7">Keeps them awake, and that in spite of hell.&rdquo;</p></td>

<p id="d0305am-p4">Christians who isolate themselves and walk alone, are very liable to grow drowsy. Hold Christian company, and you will be kept wakeful by it, and refreshed and encouraged to make quicker progress in the road to heaven. But as you thus take &ldquo;sweet counsel&rdquo; with others in the ways of God, take care that the theme of your converse is the Lord Jesus. Let the eye of faith be constantly looking unto him; let your heart be full of him; let your lips speak of his worth. Friend, live near to the cross, and thou wilt not sleep. <em>Labour to impress thyself with </em><em>a deep sense of the value of the place to which thou art </em><em>going</em>. If thou rememberest that thou art going to heaven, thou wilt not sleep on the road. If thou thinkest that hell is behind thee, and the devil pursuing thee, thou wilt not loiter. Would the manslayer sleep with the avenger of blood behind him, and the city of refuge before him? Christian, wilt thou sleep whilst the pearly gates are open—the songs of angels waiting for thee to join them—a crown of gold ready for thy brow? Ah! no; in holy fellowship continue to watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>

<p id="d0305pm-p3">What does this sweet prayer teach me? It shall be my evening&rsquo;s petition; but first let it yield me an instructive meditation. The text informs me first of all that <em>David had </em><em>his doubts</em>; for why should he pray, &ldquo;Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation,&rdquo; if he were not sometimes exercised with doubts and fears? Let me, then, be of good cheer, for I am not the only saint who has to complain of weakness of faith. If David doubted, I need not conclude that I am no Christian because I have doubts. The text reminds me that <em>David was not content </em><em>while he had doubts and fears</em>, but he repaired at once to the mercy-seat to pray for assurance; for he valued it as much fine gold. I too must labour after an abiding sense of my acceptance in the Beloved, and must have no joy when his love is not shed abroad in my soul. When my Bridegroom is gone from me, my soul must and will fast. I learn also that <em>David knew where </em><em>to obtain full assurance</em>. He went to his God in prayer, crying, &ldquo;Say unto my soul I am thy salvation.&rdquo; I must be much alone with God if I would have a clear sense of Jesus&rsquo; love. Let my prayers cease, and my eye of faith will grow dim. Much in prayer, much in heaven; slow in prayer, slow in progress. I notice that <em>David would not be satisfied unless his assurance </em><em>had a divine source</em>. &ldquo;Say unto my soul.&rdquo; Lord, do <em>thou</em> say it! Nothing short of a divine testimony in the soul will ever content the true Christian. Moreover, David could not rest unless his assurance had <em>a vivid personality</em> about it. &ldquo;Say unto <em>my</em> soul, I am <em>thy</em> salvation.&rdquo; Lord, if thou shouldst say this to all the saints, it were nothing, unless thou shouldst say it to me. Lord, I have sinned; I deserve not thy smile; I scarcely dare to ask it; but oh! say to <em>my</em> soul, even to <em>my</em> soul, &ldquo;I am <em>thy</em> salvation.&rdquo; Let me have a present, personal, infallible, indisputable sense that I am thine, and that thou art mine.</p>
