<p id="d0814am-p3">Do you believe that your sins are forgiven, and that Christ has made a full atonement for them? Then what a joyful Christian <em>you ought to be</em>! How you should live above the common trials and troubles of the world! Since sin is forgiven, can it matter what happens to you now? Luther said, &ldquo;Smite, Lord, smite, for my sin is forgiven; if thou hast but forgiven me, smite as hard as thou wilt;&rdquo; and in a similar spirit you may say, &ldquo;Send sickness, poverty, losses, crosses, persecution, what thou wilt, <em>thou hast forgiven me</em>, and my soul is glad.&rdquo; Christian, if thou art thus saved, whilst thou art glad, <em>be grateful and </em><em>loving</em>. Cling to that cross which took thy sin away; serve thou him who served thee. &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.&rdquo; Let not your zeal evaporate in some little ebullition of song. Show your love in expressive tokens. Love the brethren of him who loved you. If there be a Mephibosheth anywhere who is lame or halt, help him for Jonathan&rsquo;s sake. If there be a poor tried believer, weep with him, and bear his cross for the sake of him who wept for thee and carried thy sins. Since thou art thus forgiven freely for Christ&rsquo;s sake, go and tell to others the joyful news of pardoning mercy. Be not contented with this unspeakable blessing for thyself alone, but publish abroad the story of the cross. Holy gladness and holy boldness will make you a good preacher, and all the world will be a pulpit for you to preach in. Cheerful holiness is the most forcible of sermons, but the Lord must give it you. Seek it this morning before you go into the world. When it is the Lord&rsquo;s work in which we rejoice, we need not be afraid of being too glad.</p>

<p align="center" id="d0814pm-p1"><a id="d0814pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0814am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>

<p id="d0814pm-p3">The child is cheered as he sings, &ldquo;This my father knows;&rdquo; and shall not we be comforted as we discern that our dear Friend and tender soul-husband knows all about us?</p>
<p id="d0814pm-p4">1. <em>He is the Physician</em>, and if he knows all, there is no need that the patient should know. Hush, thou silly, fluttering heart, prying, peeping, and suspecting! What thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter, and meanwhile Jesus, the beloved Physician, knows thy soul in adversities. Why need the patient analyze all the medicine, or estimate all the symptoms? This is the Physician&rsquo;s work, not mine; it is my business to trust, and his to prescribe. If he shall write his prescription in uncouth characters which I cannot read, I will not be uneasy on that account, but rely upon his unfailing skill to make all plain in the result, however mysterious in the working.</p>
<p id="d0814pm-p5">2. <em>He is the Master</em>, and his knowledge is to serve us instead of our own; we are to obey, not to judge: &ldquo;The servant knoweth not what his lord doeth.&rdquo; Shall the architect explain his plans to every hodman on the works? If he knows his own intent, is it not enough? The vessel on the wheel cannot guess to what pattern it shall be conformed, but if the potter understands his art, what matters the ignorance of the clay? My Lord must not be cross-questioned any more by one so ignorant as I am.</p>
<p id="d0814pm-p6">3. <em>He is the Head</em>. All understanding centres there. What judgment has the arm? What comprehension has the foot? All the power to know lies in the head. Why should the member have a brain of its own when the head fulfils for it every intellectual office? Here, then, must the believer rest his comfort in sickness, not that he himself can see the end, but that Jesus knows all. Sweet Lord, be thou forever eye, and soul, and head for us, and let us be content to know only what thou choosest to reveal.</p>
