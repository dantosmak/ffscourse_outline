<p id="d0118am-p3">How different will be the state of the believer in heaven from what it is here! Here he is born to toil and suffer weariness, but in the land of the immortal, fatigue is never known. Anxious to serve his Master, he finds his strength unequal to his zeal: his constant cry is, &ldquo;Help me to serve thee, O my God.&rdquo; If he be thoroughly active, he will have much labour; not too much for his will, but more than enough for his power, so that he will cry out, &ldquo;I am not wearied <em>of</em> the labour, but I am wearied <em>in it</em>.&rdquo; Ah! Christian, the hot day of weariness lasts not forever; the sun is nearing the horizon; it shall rise again with a brighter day than thou hast ever seen upon a land where they serve God day and night, and yet rest from their labours. <em>Here</em>, rest is but partial, <em>there</em>, it is <em>perfect</em>. <em>Here</em>, the Christian is always unsettled; he feels that he has not yet attained. <em>There</em>, all are at rest; they have attained the summit of the mountain; they have ascended to the bosom of their God. Higher they cannot go. Ah, toil-worn labourer, only think when thou shalt rest forever! Canst thou conceive it? It is a rest <em>eternal</em>; a rest that &ldquo;remaineth.&rdquo; Here, my best joys bear &ldquo;mortal&rdquo; on their brow; my fair flowers fade; my dainty cups are drained to dregs; my sweetest birds fall before Death&rsquo;s arrows; my most pleasant days are shadowed into nights; and the flood-tides of my bliss subside into ebbs of sorrow; but <em>there</em>, everything is immortal; the harp abides unrusted, the crown unwithered, the eye undimmed, the voice unfaltering, the heart unwavering, and the immortal being is wholly absorbed in infinite delight. Happy day! happy! when mortality shall be swallowed up of life, and the Eternal Sabbath shall begin.</p>

<p id="d0118pm-p3">The two disciples on the road to Emmaus had a most profitable journey. Their companion and teacher was <em>the best of tutors</em>; the interpreter one of a thousand, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. The Lord Jesus condescended to become a preacher of the gospel, and he was not ashamed to exercise his calling before an audience of two persons, neither does he now refuse to become the teacher of even one. Let us court the company of so excellent an Instructor, for till he is made unto us wisdom we shall never be wise unto salvation.</p>
<p id="d0118pm-p4">This unrivalled tutor used as his class-book <em>the best of </em><em>books</em>. Although able to reveal fresh truth, he preferred to expound the old. He knew by his omniscience what was the most instructive way of teaching, and by turning at once to Moses and the prophets, he showed us that the surest road to wisdom is not speculation, reasoning, or reading human books, but meditation upon the Word of God. The readiest way to be spiritually rich in heavenly knowledge is to dig in this mine of diamonds, to gather pearls from this heavenly sea. When Jesus himself sought to enrich others, he wrought in the quarry of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p id="d0118pm-p5">The favoured pair were led to consider <em>the best of </em><em>subjects</em>, for Jesus spake of Jesus, and expounded the things concerning himself. Here the diamond cut the diamond, and what could be more admirable? The Master of the House unlocked his own doors, conducted the guests to his table, and placed his own dainties upon it. He who hid the treasure in the field himself guided the searchers to it. Our Lord would naturally discourse upon the sweetest of topics, and he could find none sweeter than his own person and work: with an eye to these we should always search the Word. O for grace to study the Bible with Jesus as both our teacher and our lesson!</p>
