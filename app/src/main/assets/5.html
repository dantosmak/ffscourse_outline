<p id="d0105am-p3">Light might well be good since it sprang from that fiat of goodness, &ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo; We who enjoy it should be more grateful for it than we are, and see more of God in it and by it. Light <em>physical</em> is said by Solomon to be sweet, but <em>gospel</em> light is infinitely more precious, for it reveals eternal things, and ministers to our immortal natures. When the Holy Spirit gives us <em>spiritual</em> light, and opens our eyes to behold the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, we behold sin in its true colours, and ourselves in our real position; we see the Most Holy God as he reveals himself, the plan of mercy as he propounds it, and the world to come as the Word describes it. Spiritual light has many beams and prismatic colours, but whether they be knowledge, joy, holiness, or life, all are divinely good. If the light received be thus good, what must the <em>essential</em> light be, and how glorious must be the place where he reveals himself. O Lord, since light is so good, give us more of it, and more of thyself, the true light.</p>
<p id="d0105am-p4">No sooner is there a good thing in the world, than <em>a </em><em>division is necessary</em>. Light and darkness have no communion; God has divided them, let us not confound them. Sons of light must not have fellowship with deeds, doctrines, or deceits of darkness. The children of the day must be sober, honest, and bold in their Lord&rsquo;s work, leaving the works of darkness to those who shall dwell in it forever. Our Churches should by discipline divide the light from the darkness, and we should by our distinct separation from the world do the same. In judgment, in action, in hearing, in teaching, in association, we must discern between the precious and the vile, and maintain the great distinction which the Lord made upon the world&rsquo;s first day. O Lord Jesus, be thou our light throughout the whole of this day, for thy light is the light of men.</p>

<p align="center" id="d0105pm-p1"><a id="d0105pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0105am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d0105pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;And God saw the light.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d0105pm-p2.1" id="d0105pm-p2.1"></a>

<p id="d0105pm-p3">This morning we noticed the goodness of the light, and the Lord&rsquo;s dividing it from the darkness, we now note the special eye which the Lord had for the light. &ldquo;God saw the light&rdquo;—he looked at it with complacency, gazed upon it with pleasure, saw that it &ldquo;was good.&rdquo; If the Lord has given you light, dear reader, he looks on that light with peculiar interest; for not only is it dear to him as his own handiwork, but because it is like himself, for &ldquo;He is light.&rdquo; Pleasant it is to the believer to know that God&rsquo;s eye is thus tenderly observant of that work of grace which he has begun. He never loses sight of the treasure which he has placed in our earthen vessels. Sometimes we cannot see the light, but God always sees the light, and that is much better than our seeing it. Better for the judge to see my innocence than for me to think I see it. It is very comfortable for me to know that I am one of God&rsquo;s people—but whether <em>I</em> know it or not, if the Lord knows it, I am still safe. This is the foundation, &ldquo;The Lord knoweth them that are his.&rdquo; You may be sighing and groaning because of inbred sin, and mourning over your darkness, yet the Lord sees &ldquo;light&rdquo; in your heart, for he has put it there, and all the cloudiness and gloom of your soul cannot conceal your light from his gracious eye. You may have sunk low in despondency, and even despair; but if your soul has any longing towards Christ, and if you are seeking to rest in his finished work, God sees the &ldquo;light.&rdquo; He not only <em>sees</em> it, but he also <em>preserves</em> it in you. &ldquo;I, the Lord, do keep it.&rdquo; This is a precious thought to those who, after anxious watching and guarding of themselves, feel their own powerlessness to do so. The light thus preserved by his grace, he will one day develop into the splendour of noonday, and the fulness of glory. The light within is the dawn of the eternal day.</p>
