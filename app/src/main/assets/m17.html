<p id="d0317am-p3">Why does God allow so many of his children to be poor? He could make them all rich if he pleased; he could lay bags of gold at their doors; he could send them a large annual income; or he could scatter round their houses abundance of provisions, as once he made the quails lie in heaps round the camp of Israel, and rained bread out of heaven to feed them. There is no necessity that they should be poor, except that he sees it to be best. &ldquo;The cattle upon a thousand hills are his&rdquo;—he could supply them; he could make the richest, the greatest, and the mightiest bring all their power and riches to the feet of his children, for the hearts of all men are in his control. But he does not choose to do so; he allows them to suffer want, he allows them to pine in penury and obscurity. Why is this? There are many reasons: one is, <em>to give us, who are favoured with </em><em>enough, an opportunity of showing our love to Jesus</em>. We show our love to Christ when we sing of him and when we pray to him; but if there were no sons of need in the world we should lose the sweet privilege of evidencing our love, by ministering in alms-giving to his poorer brethren; he has ordained that thus we should prove that our love standeth not in word only, but in deed and in truth. If we truly love Christ, we shall care for those who are loved by him. Those who are dear to him will be dear to us. Let us then look upon it not as a duty but as a privilege to relieve the poor of the Lord&rsquo;s flock—remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.&rdquo; Surely this assurance is sweet enough, and this motive strong enough to lead us to help others with a willing hand and a loving heart—recollecting that all we do for his people is graciously accepted by Christ as done to himself.</p>

<h3 align="center" id="d0317pm-p2.2"><a id="d0317pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Matthew_5:9" onclick="return goBible('nt','Matt','5','9','5','9');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Matt 5:9 - 5:9')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Matt_5_9_0_0">Matthew 5:9</a></h3>
<p id="d0317pm-p3">This is the seventh of the beatitudes: and seven was the number of perfection among the Hebrews. It may be that the Saviour placed the peacemaker the seventh upon the list because he most nearly approaches the perfect man in Christ Jesus. He who would have perfect blessedness, so far as it can be enjoyed on earth, must attain to this seventh benediction, and become a peacemaker. There is a significance also in the position of the text. The verse which precedes it speaks of the blessedness of &ldquo;the pure in heart: for they shall see God.&rdquo; It is well to understand that we are to be &ldquo;first pure, then peaceable.&rdquo; Our peaceableness is never to be a compact with sin, or toleration of evil. We must set our faces like flints against everything which is contrary to God and his holiness: purity being in our souls a settled matter, we can go on to peaceableness. Not less does the verse that follows seem to have been put there on purpose. However peaceable we may be in this world, yet we shall be misrepresented and misunderstood: and no marvel, for even the Prince of Peace, by his very peacefulness, brought fire upon the earth. He himself, though he loved mankind, and did no ill, was &ldquo;despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.&rdquo; Lest, therefore, the peaceable in heart should be surprised when they meet with enemies, it is added in the following verse, &ldquo;Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; Thus, the peacemakers are not only pronounced to be blessed, but they are compassed about with blessings. Lord, give us grace to climb to this seventh beatitude! Purify our minds that we may be &ldquo;first pure, then peaceable,&rdquo; and fortify our souls, that our peaceableness may not lead us into cowardice and despair, when for thy sake we are persecuted.</p>
