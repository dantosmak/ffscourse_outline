<p id="d1118am-p3">In this metaphor, which has reference to the inner life of a believer, we have very plainly the idea of <em>secrecy</em>. It is a spring <em>shut up</em>: just as there were springs in the East, over which an edifice was built, so that none could reach them save those who knew the secret entrance; so is the heart of a believer when it is renewed by grace: there is a mysterious life within which no human skill can touch. It is a secret which no other man knoweth; nay, which the very man who is the possessor of it cannot tell to his neighbour. The text includes not only secrecy, but <em>separation</em>. It is not the common spring, of which every passer-by may drink, it is one kept and preserved from all others; it is a fountain bearing a particular mark—a king&rsquo;s royal seal, so that all can perceive that it is not a common fountain, but a fountain owned by a proprietor, and placed specially by itself alone. So is it with the spiritual life. The chosen of God were separated in the eternal decree; they were separated by God in the day of redemption; and they are separated by the possession of a life which others have not; and it is impossible for them to feel at home with the world, or to delight in its pleasures. There is also the idea of <em>sacredness</em>. The spring shut up is preserved for the use of some special person: and such is the Christian&rsquo;s heart. It is a spring kept for Jesus. Every Christian should feel that he has God&rsquo;s seal upon him—and he should be able to say with Paul, &ldquo;From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Another idea is prominent—it is that of <em>security</em>. Oh! how sure and safe is the inner life of the believer! If all the powers of earth and hell could combine against it, that immortal principle must still exist, for he who gave it pledged his life for its preservation. And who &ldquo;is he that shall harm you,&rdquo; when God is your protector?</p>

<p id="d1118pm-p3">Christ is <span id="d1118pm-p3.1">Everlasting</span>. Of him we may sing with David, &ldquo;Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever.&rdquo; Rejoice, believer, in Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Jesus always <em>was</em>. The Babe born in Bethlehem was united to the Word, which was in the beginning, by whom all things were made. The title by which Christ revealed himself to John in Patmos was, &ldquo;Him which is, and which was, and which is to come.&rdquo; If he were not God from everlasting, we could not so devoutly love him; we could not feel that he had any share in the eternal love which is the fountain of all covenant blessings; but since he was from all eternity with the Father, we trace the stream of divine love to himself equally with his Father and the blessed Spirit. As our Lord always <em>was</em>, so also he is for evermore. Jesus is not dead; &ldquo;He ever liveth to make intercession for us.&rdquo; Resort to him in all your times of need, for he is waiting to bless you still. Moreover, Jesus our Lord ever <em>shall be</em>. If God should spare your life to fulfil your full day of threescore years and ten, you will find that his cleansing fountain is still opened, and his precious blood has not lost its power; you shall find that the Priest who filled the healing fount with his own blood, lives to purge you from all iniquity. When only your last battle remains to be fought, you shall find that the hand of your conquering Captain has not grown feeble—the living Saviour shall cheer the dying saint. When you enter heaven you shall find him there bearing the dew of his youth; and through eternity the Lord Jesus shall still remain the perennial spring of joy, and life, and glory to his people. Living waters may you draw from this sacred well! Jesus always was, he always is, he always shall be. He is eternal in all his attributes, in all his offices, in all his might, and willingness to bless, comfort, guard, and crown his chosen people.</p>
