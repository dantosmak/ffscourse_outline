<p id="d0229am-p3">The thunders of the law and the terrors of judgment are all used to bring us to Christ; but the final victory is effected by lovingkindness. The prodigal set out to his father&rsquo;s house from a sense of need; but his father saw him a great way off, and ran to meet him; so that the last steps he took towards his father&rsquo;s house were with the kiss still warm upon his cheek, and the welcome still musical in his ears.</p>
<table id="d0229am-p3.1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p id="d0229am-p3.2">&ldquo;Law and terrors do but harden</p>
        <p id="d0229am-p3.3">All the while they work alone;</p>
        <p id="d0229am-p3.4">But a sense of blood-bought pardon</p>
        <p id="d0229am-p3.5">Will dissolve a heart of stone.&rdquo;</p></td>
    </tr>

<p id="d0229am-p4">The Master came one night to the door, and knocked with the iron hand of the law; the door shook and trembled upon its hinges; but the man piled every piece of furniture which he could find against the door, for he said, &ldquo;I will not admit the man.&rdquo; The Master turned away, but by-and-bye he came back, and with his own soft hand, using most that part where the nail had penetrated, he knocked again—oh, so softly and tenderly. This time the door did not shake, but, strange to say, it opened, and there upon his knees the once unwilling host was found rejoicing to receive his guest. &ldquo;Come in, come in; thou hast so knocked that my bowels are moved for thee. I could not think of thy pierced hand leaving its blood-mark on my door, and of thy going away houseless, &lsquo;Thy head filled with dew, and thy locks with the drops of the night.&rsquo; I yield, I yield, thy love has won my heart.&rdquo; So in every case: lovingkindness wins the day. What Moses with the tablets of stone could never do, Christ does with his pierced hand. Such is the doctrine of effectual calling. Do I understand it experimentally? Can I say, &ldquo;He drew me, and I followed on, glad to confess the voice divine?&rdquo; If so, may he continue to draw me, till at last I shall sit down at the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p id="d0229pm-p3">Dear reader, have you received the spirit which is of God, wrought by the Holy Ghost in your soul? The necessity of the work of the Holy Spirit in the heart may be clearly seen from this fact, that <em>all which has been done by God the Father, and </em><em>by God the Son, must be ineffectual to us, unless the Spirit </em><em>shall reveal these things to our souls</em>. What effect does the doctrine of election have upon any man until the Spirit of God enters into him? Election is a dead letter in my consciousness until the Spirit of God calls me out of darkness into marvellous light. <em>Then</em> through my calling, I see my election, and knowing myself to be called of God, I know myself to have been chosen in the eternal purpose. A covenant was made with the Lord Jesus Christ, by his Father; but what avails that covenant to us until the Holy Spirit brings us its blessings, and opens our hearts to receive them? There hang the blessings on the nail—Christ Jesus; but being short of stature, we cannot reach them; the Spirit of God takes them down and hands them to us, and thus they become actually ours. Covenant blessings in themselves are like the manna in the skies, far out of mortal reach, but the Spirit of God opens the windows of heaven and scatters the living bread around the camp of the spiritual Israel. Christ&rsquo;s finished work is like wine stored in the wine-vat; through unbelief we can neither draw nor drink. The Holy Spirit dips our vessel into this precious wine, and then we drink; but without the Spirit we are as truly dead in sin as though the Father never had elected, and though the Son had never bought us with his blood. The Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary to our well-being. Let us walk lovingly towards him and tremble at the thought of grieving him.</p>
