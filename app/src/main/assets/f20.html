<p align="center" id="d0220am-p1"><a id="d0220am-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0220pm.html">Go To Evening Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d0220am-p2"><em>&ldquo;God, that comforteth those that are cast down.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d0220am-p2.1" id="d0220am-p2.1"></a>

<h3 align="center" id="d0220am-p2.2"><a id="d0220am-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/2_Corinthians%207:6" onclick="return goBible('nt','iiCor','7','6','7','6');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iiCor 7:6 - 7:6')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_2Cor_7_6_0_0">2 Corinthians 7:6</a></h3>
<p id="d0220am-p3">And who comforteth like him? Go to some poor, melancholy, distressed child of God; tell him sweet promises, and whisper in his ear choice words of comfort; he is like the deaf adder, he listens not to the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely. He is drinking gall and wormwood, and comfort him as you may, it will be only a note or two of mournful resignation that you will get from him; you will bring forth no psalms of praise, no hallelujahs, no joyful sonnets. But let <em>God</em> come to his child, let him lift up his countenance, and the mourner&rsquo;s eyes glisten with hope. Do you not hear him sing—</p>
<table id="d0220am-p3.1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p id="d0220am-p3.2">&ldquo;'Tis paradise, if thou art here;</p>
        <p id="d0220am-p3.3">If thou depart, 'tis hell?&rdquo;</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p id="d0220am-p4">You could not have cheered him: but the Lord has done it; &ldquo;He is the God of all comfort.&rdquo; There is no balm in Gilead, but there is balm in God. There is no physician among the creatures, but the Creator is Jehovah-rophi. It is marvellous how one sweet word of God will make whole songs for Christians. One word of God is like a piece of gold, and the Christian is the gold beater, and can hammer that promise out for whole weeks. So, then, poor Christian, thou needest not sit down in despair. Go to the Comforter, and ask him to give thee consolation. Thou art a poor dry well. You have heard it said, that when a pump is dry, you must pour water down it first of all, and then you will get water, and so, Christian, when thou art dry, go to God, ask him to shed abroad his joy in thy heart, and then thy joy shall be full. Do not go to earthly acquaintances, for you will find them Job&rsquo;s comforters after all; but go first and foremost to thy &ldquo;God, that comforteth those that are cast down,&rdquo; and you will soon say, &ldquo;In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center" id="d0220pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3 align="center" id="d0220pm-p2.2"><a id="d0220pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Matthew_4:1" onclick="return goBible('nt','Matt','4','1','4','1');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Matt 4:1 - 4:1')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Matt_4_1_0_0">Matthew 4:1</a></h3>
<p id="d0220pm-p3">A holy character does not avert temptation—Jesus was tempted. When Satan tempts us, his sparks fall upon tinder; but in Christ&rsquo;s case, it was like striking sparks on water; yet the enemy continued his evil work. Now, if the devil goes on striking when there is no result, how much more will he do it when he knows what inflammable stuff our hearts are made of. Though you become greatly sanctified by the Holy Ghost, expect that the great dog of hell will bark at you still. In the haunts of men we expect to be tempted, but even seclusion will not guard us from the same trial. Jesus Christ was led away from human society into the wilderness, and was tempted of the devil. Solitude has its charms and its benefits, and may be useful in checking the lust of the eye and the pride of life; but the devil will follow us into the most lovely retreats. Do not suppose that it is only the worldly-minded who have dreadful thoughts and blasphemous temptations, for even spiritual-minded persons endure the same; and in the holiest position we may suffer the darkest temptation. The utmost consecration of spirit will not insure you against Satanic temptation. Christ was consecrated through and through. It was his meat and drink to do the will of him that sent him: and yet he was tempted! Your hearts may glow with a seraphic flame of love to Jesus, and yet the devil will try to bring you down to Laodicean lukewarmness. If you will tell me when God permits a Christian to lay aside his armour, I will tell you when Satan has left off temptation. Like the old knights in war time, we must sleep with helmet and breastplate buckled on, for the arch-deceiver will seize our first unguarded hour to make us his prey. The Lord keep us watchful in all seasons, and give us a final escape from the jaw of the lion and the paw of the bear.</p>
