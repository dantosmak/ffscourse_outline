<p id="d0810am-p3">Paul&rsquo;s marvellously rich expression indicates, that Christ is the <em>source</em> of our life. &ldquo;You hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins.&rdquo; That same voice which brought Lazarus out of the tomb raised us to newness of life. He is now the <em>substance</em> of our spiritual life. It is by his life that we live; he is in us, the hope of glory, the spring of our actions, the central thought which moves every other thought.<em>Christ is </em><em>the sustenance of our life</em>. What can the Christian feed upon but Jesus&rsquo; flesh and blood? &ldquo;This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.&rdquo; O wayworn pilgrims in this wilderness of sin, you never get a morsel to satisfy the hunger of your spirits, except ye find it in him! <em>Christ is the solace of our life</em>. All our true joys come from him; and in times of trouble, his presence is our consolation. There is nothing worth living for but him; and his lovingkindness is better than life! <em>Christ is the object of </em><em>our life</em>. As speeds the ship towards the port, so hastes the believer towards the haven of his Saviour&rsquo;s bosom. As flies the arrow to its goal, so flies the Christian towards the perfecting of his fellowship with Christ Jesus. As the soldier fights for his captain, and is crowned in his captain&rsquo;s victory, so the believer contends for Christ, and gets his triumph out of the triumphs of his Master. &ldquo;For him to live is Christ.&rdquo; <em>Christ is </em><em>the exemplar of our life</em>. Where there is the same life within, there will, there must be, to a great extent, the same developments without; and if we live in near fellowship with the Lord Jesus we shall grow like him. We shall set him before us as our Divine copy, and we shall seek to tread in his footsteps, until he shall become <em>the crown of our life in glory</em>. Oh! how safe, how honoured, how happy is the Christian, since Christ is our life!</p>

<p id="d0810pm-p3">Behold one of the great Physician&rsquo;s mightiest arts: he has power to forgive sin! While here he lived below, before the ransom had been paid, before the blood had been literally sprinkled on the mercy-seat, he had power to forgive sin. Hath he not power to do it now that he hath died? What power must dwell in him who to the utmost farthing has faithfully discharged the debts of his people! He has boundless power now that he has finished transgression and made an end of sin. If ye doubt it, see him rising from the dead! behold him in ascending splendour raised to the right hand of God! Hear him pleading before the eternal Father, pointing to his wounds, urging the merit of his sacred passion! What power to forgive is here! &ldquo;He hath ascended on high, and received gifts for men.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is exalted on high to give repentance and remission of sins.&rdquo; The most crimson sins are removed by the crimson of his blood. At this moment, dear reader, whatever thy sinfulness, Christ has power to pardon, power to pardon <em>thee</em>, and millions such as thou art. A word will speak it. He has nothing more to do to win thy pardon; all the atoning work is done. He can, in answer to thy tears, forgive thy sins today, and make thee know it. He can breathe into thy soul at this very moment a peace with God which passeth all understanding, which shall spring from perfect remission of thy manifold iniquities. Dost thou believe that? I trust thou believest it. Mayst thou experience now the power of Jesus to forgive sin! Waste no time in applying to the Physician of souls, but hasten to him with words like these:—</p>
