<p id="d0427am-p3">It is strange how little use we make of the spiritual blessings which God gives us, but it is stranger still how little use we make of God himself. Though he is &ldquo;our own God,&rdquo; we apply ourselves but little to him, and ask but little of him. How seldom do we ask counsel at the hands of the Lord! How often do we go about our business, without seeking his guidance! In our troubles how constantly do we strive to bear our burdens ourselves, instead of casting them upon the Lord, that he may sustain us! This is not because we may not, for the Lord seems to say, &ldquo;I am thine, soul, come and make use of me as thou wilt; thou mayst freely come to my store, and the oftener the more welcome.&rdquo; It is our own fault if we make not free with the riches of our God. Then, since thou hast such a friend, and he invites thee, draw from him daily. Never want whilst thou hast a God to go to; never fear or faint whilst thou hast God to help thee; go to thy treasure and take whatever thou needest—there is all that thou canst want. Learn the divine skill of making God all things to thee. He can supply thee with all, or, better still, he can be to thee instead of all. Let me urge thee, then, to make use of thy God. Make use of him <em>in prayer</em>. Go to him often, because he is <em>thy</em> God. O, wilt thou fail to use so great a privilege? Fly to him, tell him all thy wants. Use him constantly <em>by faith</em> at all times. If some dark providence has beclouded thee, use thy God as a &ldquo;sun;&rdquo; if some strong enemy has beset thee, find in Jehovah a &ldquo;shield,&rdquo; for he is a sun and shield to his people. If thou hast lost thy way in the mazes of life, use him as a &ldquo;guide,&rdquo; for he will direct thee. Whatever thou art, and wherever thou art, remember God is just <em>what</em> thou wantest, and just <em>where</em> thou wantest, and that he can do <em>all</em> thou wantest.</p>

<p id="d0427pm-p3">Jesus Christ is no despotic claimant of <em>divine right</em>, but he is really and truly the Lord&rsquo;s anointed! &ldquo;It hath pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.&rdquo; God hath given to him all power and all authority. As the Son of man, he is now head over all things to his church, and he reigns over heaven, and earth, and hell, with the keys of life and death at his girdle. Certain princes have delighted to call themselves kings by the <em>popular will</em>, and certainly our Lord Jesus Christ is such in his church. If it could be put to the vote whether he should be King in the church, every believing heart would crown him. O that we could crown him more gloriously than we do! We would count no expense to be wasted that could glorify Christ. Suffering would be pleasure, and loss would be gain, if thereby we could surround his brow with brighter crowns, and make him more glorious in the eyes of men and angels. Yes, he shall reign. Long live the King! All hail to thee, King Jesus! Go forth, ye virgin souls who love your Lord, bow at his feet, strew his way with the lilies of your love, and the roses of your gratitude: &ldquo;Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all.&rdquo; Moreover, our Lord Jesus is King in Zion by <em>right of conquest</em>: he has taken and carried by storm the hearts of his people, and has slain their enemies who held them in cruel bondage. In the Red Sea of his own blood, our Redeemer has drowned the Pharaoh of our sins: shall he not be King in Jeshurun? He has delivered us from the iron yoke and heavy curse of the law: shall not the Liberator be crowned? We are his portion, whom he has taken out of the hand of the Amorite with his sword and with his bow: who shall snatch his conquest from his hand? All hail, King Jesus! we gladly own thy gentle sway! Rule in our hearts forever, thou lovely Prince of Peace.</p>
