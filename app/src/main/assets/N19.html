<p id="d1119am-p3">Our days are few, and are far better spent in doing good, than in disputing over matters which are, at best, of minor importance. The old schoolmen did a world of mischief by their incessant discussion of subjects of no practical importance; and our Churches suffer much from petty wars over abstruse points and unimportant questions. After everything has been said that can be said, neither party is any the wiser, and therefore the discussion no more promotes knowledge than love, and it is foolish to sow in so barren a field. Questions upon points wherein Scripture is silent; upon mysteries which belong to God alone; upon prophecies of doubtful interpretation; and upon mere modes of observing human ceremonials, are all foolish, and wise men avoid them. Our business is neither to ask nor answer foolish questions, but to avoid them altogether; and if we observe the apostle&rsquo;s precept (<a id="d1119am-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Titus_3:8" onclick="return goBible('nt','Titus','3','8','3','8');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Titus 3:8 - 3:8')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Titus_3_8_0_0">Titus 3:8</a>) to be careful to maintain good works, we shall find ourselves far too much occupied with profitable business to take much interest in unworthy, contentious, and needless strivings.</p>
<p id="d1119am-p4">There are, however, some questions which are the reverse of foolish, which we must not avoid, but fairly and honestly meet, such as these: Do I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? Am I renewed in the spirit of my mind? Am I walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit? Am I growing in grace? Does my conversation adorn the doctrine of God my Saviour? Am I looking for the coming of the Lord, and watching as a servant should do who expects his master? What more can I do for Jesus? Such enquiries as these urgently demand our attention; and if we have been at all given to cavilling, let us now turn our critical abilities to a service so much more profitable. Let us be peace-makers, and endeavour to lead others both by our precept and example, to &ldquo;avoid foolish questions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center" id="d1119pm-p0.1">Evening, November 19</h2>
<p align="center" id="d1119pm-p1"><a id="d1119pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1119am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1119pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;O that I knew where I might find him!&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3 align="center" id="d1119pm-p2.2"><a id="d1119pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Job_23:3" onclick="return goBible('ot','Job','23','3','23','3');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Job 23:3 - 23:3')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Job_23_3_0_0">Job 23:3</a></h3>
<p id="d1119pm-p3">In Job&rsquo;s uttermost extremity he cried after the Lord. The longing desire of an afflicted child of God is once more to see his Father&rsquo;s face. His first prayer is not &ldquo;O that I might be healed of the disease which now festers in every part of my body!&rdquo; nor even &ldquo;O that I might see my children restored from the jaws of the grave, and my property once more brought from the hand of the spoiler!&rdquo; but the first and uppermost cry is, &ldquo;O that I knew where I might findÂ <span id="d1119pm-p3.1">Him</span>, who is my God! that I might come even to his seat!&rdquo; God&rsquo;s children run home when the storm comes on. It is the heaven-born instinct of a gracious soul to seek shelter from all ills beneath the wings of Jehovah. &ldquo;He that hath made his refuge God,&rdquo; might serve as the title of a true believer. A hypocrite, when afflicted by God, resents the infliction, and, like a slave, would run from the Master who has scourged him; but not so the true heir of heaven, he kisses the hand which smote him, and seeks shelter from the rod in the bosom of the God who frowned upon him. Job&rsquo;s desire to commune with God was intensified by the failure of all other sources of consolation. The patriarch turned away from his sorry friends, and looked up to the celestial throne, just as a traveller turns from his empty skin bottle, and betakes himself with all speed to the well. He bids farewell to earth-born hopes, and cries, &ldquo;O that I knew where I might find my God!&rdquo; Nothing teaches us so much the preciousness of the Creator, as when we learn the emptiness of all besides. Turning away with bitter scorn from earth&rsquo;s hives, where we find no honey, but many sharp stings, we rejoice in him whose faithful word is sweeter than honey or the honeycomb. In every trouble we should first seek to realize God&rsquo;s presence with us. Only let us enjoy his smile, and we can bear our daily cross with a willing heart for his dear sake.</p>
