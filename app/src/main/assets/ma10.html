<p id="d0510am-p3">The whole system of Christianity rests upon the fact that &ldquo;Christ is risen from the dead;&rdquo; for, &ldquo;If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain: ye are yet in your sins.&rdquo; The <em>divinity</em> of Christ finds its surest proof in his resurrection, since he was &ldquo;Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; It would not be unreasonable to doubt his deity if he had not risen. Moreover, Christ&rsquo;s <em>sovereignty</em> depends upon his resurrection, &ldquo;For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.&rdquo; Again, our <em>justification</em>, that choice blessing of the covenant, is linked with Christ&rsquo;s triumphant victory over death and the grave; for &ldquo;He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.&rdquo; Nay, more, our very <em>regeneration</em> is connected with his resurrection, for we are &ldquo;Begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; And most certainly our <em>ultimate resurrection</em> rests here, for, &ldquo;If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.&rdquo; If Christ be not risen, then shall we not rise; but if he be risen then they who are asleep in Christ have not perished, but in their flesh shall surely behold their God. Thus, the silver thread of resurrection runs through all the believer&rsquo;s blessings, from his regeneration onwards to his eternal glory, and binds them together. How important then will this glorious fact be in his estimation, and how will he rejoice that beyond a doubt it is established, that &ldquo;now is Christ risen from the dead&rdquo;!</p>

<p id="d0510pm-p3">Believer, you can bear your testimony that Christ is <em>the </em><em>only begotten of the Father</em>, as well as the first begotten from the dead. You can say, &ldquo;He is divine to me, if he be human to all the world beside. He has done that for me which none but a God could do. He has subdued my stubborn will, melted a heart of adamant, opened gates of brass, and snapped bars of iron. He hath turned for me my mourning into laughter, and my desolation into joy; he hath led my captivity captive, and made my heart rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Let others think as they will of him, to me he must be the only begotten of the Father: blessed be his name. And he is <em>full of grace</em>. Ah! had he not been, I should never have been saved. He drew me when I struggled to escape from his grace; and when at last I came all trembling like a condemned culprit to his mercy-seat, he said, &lsquo;Thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee: be of good cheer.&rsquo; And he is <em>full of truth</em>. True have his promises been, not one has failed. I bear witness that never servant had such a master as I have; never brother such a kinsman as he has been to me; never spouse such a husband as Christ has been to my soul; never sinner a better Saviour; never mourner a better comforter than Christ hath been to my spirit. I want none beside him. In life he is my life, and in death he shall be the death of death; in poverty Christ is my riches; in sickness he makes my bed; in darkness he is my star, and in brightness he is my sun; he is the manna of the camp in the wilderness, and he shall be the new corn of the host when they come to Canaan. Jesus is to me all grace and no wrath, all truth and no falsehood: and of truth and grace he is <em>full</em>, infinitely full. My soul, this night, bless with all thy might &lsquo;the only Begotten.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
