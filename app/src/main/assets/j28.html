<p id="d0628am-p3">It is ever the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work to turn our eyes away from self to Jesus; but Satan&rsquo;s work is just the opposite of this, for he is constantly trying to make us regard ourselves instead of Christ. He insinuates, &ldquo;Your sins are too great for pardon; you have no faith; you do not repent enough; you will never be able to continue to the end; you have not the joy of his children; you have such a wavering hold of Jesus.&rdquo; All these are thoughts about self, and we shall never find comfort or assurance by looking within. But the Holy Spirit turns our eyes entirely away from self: he tells us that we are nothing, but that &ldquo;Christ is all in all.&rdquo; Remember, therefore, it is not <em>thy hold</em> of Christ that saves thee—it is Christ; it is not <em>thy joy</em> in Christ that saves thee—it is Christ; it is not even faith in Christ, though that be the instrument—it is Christ&rsquo;s blood and merits; therefore, look not so much to thy hand with which thou art grasping Christ, as to Christ; look not to thy hope, but to Jesus, the source of thy hope; look not to thy faith, but to Jesus, the author and finisher of thy faith. We shall never find happiness by looking at our prayers, our doings, or our feelings; it is what <em>Jesus</em> is, not what we are, that gives rest to the soul. If we would at once overcome Satan and have peace with God, it must be by &ldquo;looking unto Jesus.&rdquo; Keep thine eye simply on him; let his death, his sufferings, his merits, his glories, his intercession, be fresh upon thy mind; when thou wakest in the morning look to him; when thou liest down at night look to him. Oh! let not thy hopes or fears come between thee and Jesus; follow hard after him, and he will never fail thee.</p>

<p id="d0628pm-p3">This incident is an instructive emblem of the sure victory of the divine handiwork over all opposition. Whenever a divine principle is cast into the heart, though the devil may fashion a counterfeit, and produce swarms of opponents, as sure as ever God is in the work, it will swallow up all its foes. If God&rsquo;s grace takes possession of a man, the world&rsquo;s magicians may throw down all their rods; and every rod may be as cunning and poisonous as a serpent, but Aaron&rsquo;s rod will swallow up their rods. The sweet attractions of the cross will woo and win the man&rsquo;s heart, and he who lived only for this deceitful earth will now have an eye for the upper spheres, and a wing to mount into celestial heights. When grace has won the day the worldling seeks the world to come. The same fact is to be observed in the life of the believer. What multitudes of foes has our faith had to meet! Our old sins—the devil threw them down before us, and they turned to serpents. What hosts of them! Ah, but the cross of Jesus destroys them all. Faith in Christ makes short work of all our sins. Then the devil has launched forth another host of serpents in the form of worldly trials, temptations, unbelief; but faith in Jesus is more than a match for them, and overcomes them all. The same absorbing principle shines in the faithful service of God! With an enthusiastic love for Jesus difficulties are surmounted, sacrifices become pleasures, sufferings are honours. But if religion is thus a consuming passion in the heart, then it follows that there are many persons who profess religion but have it not; for what they have will not bear this test. Examine yourself, my reader, on this point. Aaron&rsquo;s rod <em>proved</em> its heaven-given power. Is your religion doing so? If Christ be anything he must be everything. O rest not till love and faith in Jesus be the master passions of your soul!</p>
