<p id="d0127am-p3">These words tell us that there is a fulness in Christ. There is a fulness of essential Deity, for &ldquo;in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead.&rdquo; There is a fulness of perfect manhood, for in him, bodily, that Godhead was revealed. There is a fulness of atoning efficacy in his blood, for &ldquo;the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.&rdquo; There is a fulness of justifying righteousness in his life, for &ldquo;there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; There is a fulness of divine prevalence in his plea, for &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him; seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.&rdquo; There is a fulness of victory in his death, for through death he destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil. There is a fulness of efficacy in his resurrection from the dead, for by it &ldquo;we are begotten again unto a lively hope.&rdquo; There is a fulness of triumph in his ascension, for &ldquo;when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.&rdquo; There is a fulness of blessings of every sort and shape; a fulness of grace to pardon, of grace to regenerate, of grace to sanctify, of grace to preserve, and of grace to perfect. There is a fulness at all times; a fulness of comfort in affliction; a fulness of guidance in prosperity. A fulness of every divine attribute, of wisdom, of power, of love; a fulness which it were impossible to survey, much less to explore. &ldquo;It pleased the Father that in him should <em>all</em> fulness dwell.&rdquo; Oh, what a fulness must this be of which <em>all</em> receive! Fulness, indeed, must there be when the stream is always flowing, and yet the well springs up as free, as rich, as full as ever. Come, believer, and get all thy need supplied; ask largely, and thou shalt receive largely, for this &ldquo;fulness&rdquo; is inexhaustible, and is treasured up where all the needy may reach it, even in Jesus, Immanuel—God with us.</p>

<p id="d0127pm-p3">There was an exercise, on the part of this blessed woman, of three powers of her being: her <em>memory</em>—she kept all these things; her<em>affections</em>—she kept them in her heart; her <em>intellect</em>—she pondered them; so that memory, affection, and understanding, were all exercised about the things which she had heard. Beloved, remember what you have heard of your Lord Jesus, and what he has done for you; make your heart the golden pot of manna to preserve the memorial of the heavenly bread whereon you have fed in days gone by. Let your memory treasure up everything about Christ which you have either felt, or known, or believed, and then let your fond affections hold <em>him</em>fast for evermore. Love the person of your Lord! Bring forth the alabaster box of your heart, even though it be broken, and let all the precious ointment of your affection come streaming on his pierced feet. Let your intellect be exercised concerning the Lord Jesus. Meditate upon what you read: stop not at the surface; dive into the depths. Be not as the swallow which toucheth the brook with her wing, but as the fish which penetrates the lowest wave. Abide with your Lord: let him not be to you as a wayfaring man, that tarrieth for a night, but constrain him, saying, &ldquo;Abide with us, for the day is far spent.&rdquo; Hold him, and do not let him go. The word &ldquo;ponder,&rdquo; means to weigh. Make ready the balances of judgment. Oh, but where are the scales that can weigh the Lord Christ? &ldquo;He taketh up the isles as a very little thing:&rdquo;—who shall take <em>him</em> up? &ldquo;He weigheth the mountains in scales&rdquo;—in what scales shall we weigh <em>him</em>? Be it so, if your understanding cannot comprehend, let your affections apprehend; and if your spirit cannot compass the Lord Jesus in the grasp of understanding, let it embrace him in the arms of affection.</p>
