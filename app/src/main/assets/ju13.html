<p id="d0713am-p3">Anger is not always or necessarily sinful, but it has such a tendency to run wild that whenever it displays itself, we should be quick to question its character, with this enquiry, &ldquo;Doest thou well to be angry?&rdquo; It may be that we can answer, &ldquo;YES.&rdquo; Very frequently anger is the madman&rsquo;s firebrand, but sometimes it is Elijah&rsquo;s fire from heaven. We do well when we are angry with sin, because of the wrong which it commits against our good and gracious God; or with ourselves because we remain so foolish after so much divine instruction; or with others when the sole cause of anger is the evil which they do. He who is not angry at transgression becomes a partaker in it. Sin is a loathsome and hateful thing, and no renewed heart can patiently endure it. God himself is angry with the wicked every day, and it is written in His Word, &ldquo;Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.&rdquo; Far more frequently it is to be feared that our anger is not commendable or even justifiable, and then we must answer, &ldquo;NO.&rdquo; Why should we be fretful with children, passionate with servants, and wrathful with companions? Is such anger honourable to our Christian profession, or glorifying to God? Is it not the old evil heart seeking to gain dominion, and should we not resist it with all the might of our newborn nature? Many professors give way to temper as though it were useless to attempt resistance; but let the believer remember that he must be a conqueror in every point, or else he cannot be crowned. If we cannot control our tempers, what has grace done for us? Some one told Mr. Jay that grace was often grafted on a crab-stump. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but the fruit will not be crabs.&rdquo; We must not make natural infirmity an excuse for sin, but we must fly to the cross and pray the Lord to crucify our tempers, and renew us in gentleness and meekness after His own image.</p>

<p id="d0713pm-p3">It is impossible for any human speech to express the full meaning of this delightful phrase, &ldquo;<em>God is for me</em>.&rdquo; He was &ldquo;for us&rdquo; before the worlds were made; he was &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; or he would not have given his well-beloved son; he was &ldquo;for us&rdquo; when he smote the Only-begotten, and laid the full weight of his wrath upon him—he was &ldquo;for <em>us</em>,&rdquo; though he was against <em>him</em>; he was &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; when we were ruined in the fall—he loved us notwithstanding all; he was &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; when we were rebels against him, and with a high hand were bidding him defiance; he was &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; or he would not have brought us humbly to seek his face. He has been &ldquo;for us&rdquo; in many struggles; we have been summoned to encounter hosts of dangers; we have been assailed by temptations from without and within—how could we have remained unharmed to this hour if he had not been &ldquo;for us&rdquo;? He is &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; with all the infinity of his being; with all the omnipotence of his love; with all the infallibility of his wisdom; arrayed in all his divine attributes, he is &ldquo;for us,&rdquo;—eternally and immutably &ldquo;for us&rdquo;; &ldquo;for us&rdquo; when yon blue skies shall be rolled up like a worn out vesture; &ldquo;for us&rdquo; throughout eternity. And because he is &ldquo;for us,&rdquo; the voice of prayer will always ensure his help. &ldquo;<em>When I cry unto thee, </em><em>then shall mine enemies be turned back</em>.&rdquo; This is no uncertain hope, but a well grounded assurance—&ldquo;<em>this I </em><em>know</em>.&rdquo; I will direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up for the answer, assured that it will come, and that mine enemies shall be defeated, &ldquo;for God is for me.&rdquo; O believer, how happy art thou with the King of kings on thy side! How safe with such a Protector! How sure thy cause pleaded by such an Advocate! If God be for thee, who can be against thee?</p>
