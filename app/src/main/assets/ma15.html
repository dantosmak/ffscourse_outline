<p id="d0515am-p3">The believer in Christ receives a <em>present</em> justification. Faith does not produce this fruit by-and-by, but <em>now</em>. So far as justification is the result of faith, it is given to the soul in the moment when it closes with Christ, and accepts him as its all in all. Are they who stand before the throne of God justified now?—so are we, as truly and as clearly justified as they who walk in white and sing melodious praises to celestial harps. The thief upon the cross was justified the moment that he turned the eye of faith to Jesus; and Paul, the aged, after years of service, was not more justified than was the thief with no service at all. We are <em>today</em> accepted in the Beloved, <em>today</em> absolved from sin, <em>today</em>acquitted at the bar of God. Oh! soul-transporting thought! There are some clusters of Eshcol&rsquo;s vine which we shall not be able to gather till we enter heaven; but this is a bough which runneth over the wall. This is not as the corn of the land, which we can never eat till we cross the Jordan; but this is part of the manna in the wilderness, a portion of our daily nutriment with which God supplies us in our journeying to and fro. We are <em>now</em>—even <em>now</em> pardoned; even <em>now</em> are our sins put away; even <em>now</em> we stand in the sight of God accepted, as though we had never been guilty. &ldquo;There is therefore <em>now</em> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; There is not a sin in the Book of God, even <em>now</em>, against one of his people. Who dareth to lay anything to their charge? There is neither speck, nor spot, nor wrinkle, nor any such thing remaining upon any one believer in the matter of justification in the sight of the Judge of all the earth. Let present privilege awaken us to present duty, and now, while life lasts, let us spend and be spent for our sweet Lord Jesus.</p>

<p align="center" id="d0515pm-p1"><a id="d0515pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0515am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d0515pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;Made perfect.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p id="d0515pm-p3">Recollect that there are two kinds of perfection which the Christian needs—the perfection of justification in the person of Jesus, and the perfection of sanctification wrought in him by the Holy Spirit. At present, corruption yet remains even in the breasts of the regenerate—experience soon teaches us this. Within us are still lusts and evil imaginations. But I rejoice to know that the day is coming when God shall finish the work which he has begun; and he shall present my soul, not only perfect in Christ, but perfect through the Spirit, without spot or blemish, or any such thing. Can it be true that this poor sinful heart of mine is to become holy even as God is holy? Can it be that this spirit, which often cries, &ldquo;O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this sin and death?&rdquo; shall get rid of sin and death—that I shall have no evil things to vex my ears, and no unholy thoughts to disturb my peace? Oh, happy hour! may it be hastened! When I cross the Jordan, the work of sanctification will be finished; but not till that moment shall I even claim perfection in myself. Then my spirit shall have its last baptism in the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s fire. Methinks I long to die to receive that last and final purification which shall usher me into heaven. Not an angel more pure than I shall be, for I shall be able to say, in a double sense, &ldquo;I am clean,&rdquo; through Jesus&rsquo; blood, and through the Spirit&rsquo;s work. Oh, how should we extol the power of the Holy Ghost in thus making us fit to stand before our Father in heaven! Yet let not the hope of perfection hereafter make us content with imperfection now. If it does this, our hope cannot be genuine; for a good hope is a purifying thing, even now. The work of grace must be <em>abiding </em><em>in us now</em> or it cannot be <em>perfected then</em>. Let us pray to &ldquo;be filled with the Spirit,&rdquo; that we may bring forth <em>increasingly</em> the fruits of righteousness.</p>
