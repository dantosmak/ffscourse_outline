<p id="d0222am-p3">That strength which God gives to his Josephs is <em>real</em> strength; it is not a boasted valour, a fiction, a thing of which men talk, but which ends in smoke; it is true—<em>divine </em><em>strength</em>. Why does Joseph stand against temptation? Because God gives him aid. There is nought that we can do without the power of God. All true strength comes from &ldquo;the mighty God of Jacob.&rdquo; Notice in what a <em>blessedly familiar way</em> God gives this strength to Joseph—&ldquo;The arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.&rdquo; Thus God is represented as putting his hands on Joseph&rsquo;s hands, placing his arms on Joseph&rsquo;s arms. Like as a father teaches his children, so the Lord teaches them that fear him. He puts his arms upon them. Marvellous condescension! God Almighty, Eternal, Omnipotent, stoops from his throne and lays his hand upon the child&rsquo;s hand, stretching his arm upon the arm of Joseph, that he may be made strong! This strength was also covenant strength, for it is ascribed to &ldquo;the mighty <em>God of Jacob</em>.&rdquo; Now, wherever you read of the God of Jacob in the Bible, you should remember the covenant with Jacob. Christians love to think of God&rsquo;s covenant. All the power, all the grace, all the blessings, all the mercies, all the comforts, all the things we have, flow to us from the well-head, through the covenant. If there were no covenant, then we should fail indeed; for all grace proceeds from it, as light and heat from the sun. No angels ascend or descend, save upon that ladder which Jacob saw, at the top of which stood a covenant God. Christian, it may be that the archers have sorely grieved you, and shot at you, and wounded you, but still your bow abides in strength; be sure, then, to ascribe all the glory to Jacob&rsquo;s God.</p>

<p id="d0222pm-p3">Jehovah &ldquo;<em>is slow to anger</em>.&rdquo; When mercy cometh into the world she driveth winged steeds; the axles of her chariot-wheels are red hot with speed; but when wrath goeth forth, it toileth on with tardy footsteps, for God taketh no pleasure in the sinner&rsquo;s death. God&rsquo;s rod of mercy is ever in his hands outstretched; his sword of justice is in its scabbard, held down by that pierced hand of love which bled for the sins of men. &ldquo;The Lord is slow to anger,&rdquo; because he is <span id="d0222pm-p3.1">great in power</span>. He is truly great in power who hath power over himself. When God&rsquo;s power doth restrain himself, then it is power indeed: the power that binds omnipotence is omnipotence surpassed. A man who has a strong mind can bear to be insulted long, and only resents the wrong when a sense of right demands his action. The weak mind is irritated at a little: the strong mind bears it like a rock which moveth not, though a thousand breakers dash upon it, and cast their pitiful malice in spray upon its summit. God marketh his enemies, and yet he bestirs not himself, but holdeth in his anger. If he were less divine than he is, he would long ere this have sent forth the whole of his thunders, and emptied the magazines of heaven; he would long ere this have blasted the earth with the wondrous fires of its lower regions, and man would have been utterly destroyed; but the greatness of his power brings us mercy. Dear reader, what is your state this evening? Can you by humble faith look to Jesus, and say, &ldquo;My substitute, thou art my rock, my trust&rdquo;? Then, beloved, be not afraid of God&rsquo;s power; for by faith you have fled to Christ for refuge, the power of God need no more terrify you, than the shield and sword of the warrior need terrify those whom he loves. Rather rejoice that he who is &ldquo;great in power&rdquo; is your Father and Friend.</p>
