<p id="d0402am-p3">He had never been slow of speech when he could bless the sons of men, but he would not say a single word for himself. &ldquo;Never man spake like this man,&rdquo; and never man was silent like him. Was this singular silence <em>the index of his perfect self-sacrifice</em>? Did it show that he would not utter a word to stay the slaughter of his sacred person, which he had dedicated as an offering for us? Had he so entirely surrendered himself that he would not interfere in his own behalf, even in the minutest degree, but be bound and slain an unstruggling, uncomplaining victim? Was this silence <em>a type of the </em><em>defencelessness of sin</em>? Nothing can be said in palliation or excuse of human guilt; and, therefore, he who bore its whole weight stood speechless before his judge. Is not patient silence <em>the best reply to a gainsaying world</em>? Calm endurance answers some questions infinitely more conclusively than the loftiest eloquence. The best apologists for Christianity in the early days were its martyrs. The anvil breaks a host of hammers by quietly bearing their blows. Did not the silent Lamb of God furnish us with <em>a grand example of wisdom</em>? Where every word was occasion for new blasphemy, it was the line of duty to afford no fuel for the flame of sin. The ambiguous and the false, the unworthy and mean, will ere long overthrow and confute themselves, and therefore the true can afford to be quiet, and finds silence to be its wisdom. Evidently our Lord, by his silence, furnished <em>a remarkable fulfilment of </em><em>prophecy</em>. A long defence of himself would have been contrary to Isaiah&rsquo;s prediction: &ldquo;He is led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.&rdquo; By his quiet he conclusively proved himself to be the true Lamb of God. As such we salute him this morning. Be with us, Jesus, and in the silence of our heart, let us hear the voice of thy love.</p>

<p id="d0402pm-p3">Plead for the speedy fulfilment of this promise, all ye who love the Lord. It is easy work to pray when we are grounded and bottomed, as to our desires, upon God&rsquo;s own promise. How can he that gave the word refuse to keep it? Immutable veracity cannot demean itself by a lie, and eternal faithfulness cannot degrade itself by neglect. God must bless his Son, his covenant binds him to it. That which the Spirit prompts us to ask for Jesus, is that which God decrees to give him. Whenever you are praying for the kingdom of Christ, let your eyes behold the dawning of the blessed day which draweth near, when the Crucified shall receive his coronation in the place where men rejected him. Courage, you that prayerfully work and toil for Christ with success of the very smallest kind, it shall not be so always; better times are before you. Your eyes cannot see the blissful future: borrow the telescope of faith; wipe the misty breath of your doubts from the glass; look through it and behold the coming glory. Reader, let us ask, <em>do you</em> make this your constant prayer? Remember that the same Christ who tells us to say, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread,&rdquo; had first given us this petition, &ldquo;Hallowed be thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.&rdquo; Let not your prayers be all concerning your own sins, your own wants, your own imperfections, your own trials, but let them climb the starry ladder, and get up to Christ himself, and then, as you draw nigh to the blood-sprinkled mercy-seat, offer this prayer continually, &ldquo;Lord, extend the kingdom of thy dear Son.&rdquo; Such a petition, fervently presented, will elevate the spirit of all your devotions. Mind that you prove the sincerity of your prayer by labouring to promote the Lord&rsquo;s glory.</p>
