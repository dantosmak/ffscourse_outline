<p align="center" id="d0113am-p2"><em>&ldquo;Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d0113am-p2.1" id="d0113am-p2.1"></a>

<h3 align="center" id="d0113am-p2.2"><a id="d0113am-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/1_Kings%2022:48" onclick="return goBible('ot','iKgs','22','48','22','48');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iKgs 22:48 - 22:48')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_1Kgs_22_48_0_0">1 Kings 22:48</a></h3>
<p id="d0113am-p3">Solomon&rsquo;s ships had returned in safety, but Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s vessels never reached the land of gold. Providence prospers one, and frustrates the desires of another, in the same business and at the same spot, yet the Great Ruler is as good and wise at one time as another. May we have grace today, in the remembrance of this text, to bless the Lord for ships broken at Ezion-geber, as well as for vessels freighted with temporal blessings; let us not envy the more successful, nor murmur at our losses as though we were singularly and specially tried. Like Jehoshaphat, we may be precious in the Lord&rsquo;s sight, although our schemes end in disappointment.</p>
<p id="d0113am-p4">The secret cause of Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s loss is well worthy of notice, for it is the root of very much of the suffering of the Lord&rsquo;s people; it was his alliance with a sinful family, his fellowship with sinners. In <a id="d0113am-p4.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/2_Chronicles%2020:37" onclick="return goBible('ot','iiChr','20','37','20','37');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iiChr 20:37 - 20:37')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_2Chr_20_37_0_0">2 Ch. 20:37</a>, we are told that the Lord sent a prophet to declare, &ldquo;Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath broken thy works.&rdquo; This was a fatherly chastisement, which appears to have been blest to him; for in the verse which succeeds our morning&rsquo;s text we find him refusing to allow his servants to sail in the same vessels with those of the wicked king. Would to God that Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s experience might be a warning to the rest of the Lord&rsquo;s people, to avoid being unequally yoked together with unbelievers! A life of misery is usually the lot of those who are united in marriage, or in any other way of their own choosing, with the men of the world. O for such love to Jesus that, like him, we may be holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners; for if it be not so with us, we may expect to hear it often said, <em>&ldquo;The Lord hath broken thy works.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 align="center" id="d0113pm-p0.1">Evening, January 13</h2>
<p align="center" id="d0113pm-p1"><a id="d0113pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0113am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d0113pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;The iron did swim.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d0113pm-p2.1" id="d0113pm-p2.1"></a>
</div>
<h3 align="center" id="d0113pm-p2.2"><a id="d0113pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/2_Kings%206:6" onclick="return goBible('ot','iiKgs','6','6','6','6');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iiKgs 6:6 - 6:6')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_2Kgs_6_6_0_0">2 Kings 6:6</a></h3>
<p id="d0113pm-p3">The axe-head seemed hopelessly lost, and as it was borrowed, the honour of the prophetic band was likely to be imperilled, and so the name of their God to be compromised. Contrary to all expectation, the iron was made to mount from the depth of the stream and to swim; for things impossible with man are possible with God. I knew a man in Christ but a few years ago who was called to undertake a work far exceeding his strength. It appeared so difficult as to involve absurdity in the bare idea of attempting it. Yet he was called thereto, and his faith rose with the occasion; God honoured his faith, unlooked-for aid was sent, and the iron did swim. Another of the Lord&rsquo;s family was in grievous financial straits, he was able to meet all claims, and much more if he could have realized a certain portion of his estate, but he was overtaken with a sudden pressure; he sought for friends in vain, but faith led him to the unfailing Helper, and lo, the trouble was averted, his footsteps were enlarged, and the iron did swim. A third had a sorrowful case of depravity to deal with. He had taught, reproved, warned, invited, and interceded, but all in vain. Old Adam was too strong for young Melancthon, the stubborn spirit would not relent. Then came an agony of prayer, and before long a blessed answer was sent from heaven. The hard heart was broken, the iron did swim.</p>
<p id="d0113pm-p4">Beloved reader, what is thy desperate case? What heavy matter hast thou in hand this evening? Bring it hither. The God of the prophets lives, and lives to help his saints. He will not suffer thee to lack any good thing. Believe thou in the Lord of hosts! Approach him pleading the name of Jesus, and the iron shall swim; thou too shalt see the finger of God working marvels for his people. According to thy faith be it unto thee, and yet again the iron shall swim.</p>
