<p id="d0526am-p3">Care, even though exercised upon legitimate objects, if carried to excess, has in it the nature of sin. The precept to avoid anxious care is earnestly inculcated by our Saviour, again and again; it is reiterated by the apostles; and it is one which cannot be neglected without involving transgression: for the very essence of anxious care is the imagining that we are wiser than God, and the thrusting ourselves into his place to do for him that which he has undertaken to do for us. We attempt to think of that which we fancy he will forget; we labour to take upon ourselves our weary burden, as if he were unable or unwilling to take it for us. Now this disobedience to his plain precept, this unbelief in his Word, this presumption in intruding upon his province, is all sinful. Yet more than this, anxious care often leads to acts of sin. He who cannot calmly leave his affairs in God&rsquo;s hand, but will carry his own burden, is very likely to be tempted to use wrong means to help himself. This sin leads to a forsaking of God as our counsellor, and resorting instead to human wisdom. This is going to the &ldquo;broken cistern&rdquo; instead of to the &ldquo;fountain;&rdquo; a sin which was laid against Israel of old. Anxiety makes us doubt God&rsquo;s lovingkindness, and thus our love to him grows cold; we feel mistrust, and thus grieve the Spirit of God, so that our prayers become hindered, our consistent example marred, and our life one of self-seeking. Thus want of confidence in God leads us to wander far from him; but if through simple faith in his promise, we cast each burden as it comes upon him, and are &ldquo;careful for nothing&rdquo; because he undertakes to care for us, it will keep us close to him, and strengthen us against much temptation. &ldquo;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0526pm-p3">Perseverance is the badge of true saints. The Christian life is not a <em>beginning</em> only in the ways of God, but also a <em>continuance</em> in the same as long as life lasts. It is with a Christian as it was with the great Napoleon: he said, &ldquo;Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest must maintain me.&rdquo; So, under God, dear brother in the Lord, conquest has made you what you are, and conquest must sustain you. Your motto must be, &ldquo;Excelsior.&rdquo; He only is a true conqueror, and shall be crowned at the last, who continueth till war&rsquo;s trumpet is blown no more. Perseverance is, therefore, the target of all our spiritual enemies. The <em>world</em> does not object to your being a Christian for a time, if she can but tempt you to cease your pilgrimage, and settle down to buy and sell with her in Vanity Fair. The <em>flesh</em> will seek to ensnare you, and to prevent your pressing on to glory. &ldquo;It is weary work being a pilgrim; come, give it up. Am I always to be mortified? Am I never to be indulged? Give me at least a furlough from this constant warfare.&rdquo; <em>Satan</em> will make many a fierce attack on your perseverance; it will be the mark for all his arrows. He will strive to hinder you <em>in </em><em>service</em>: he will insinuate that you are doing no good; and that you want rest. He will endeavour to make you weary of <em>suffering</em>, he will whisper, &ldquo;Curse God, and die.&rdquo; Or he will attack your <em>steadfastness</em>: &ldquo;What is the good of being so zealous? Be quiet like the rest; sleep as do others, and let your lamp go out as the other virgins do.&rdquo; Or he will assail your <em>doctrinal sentiments</em>: &ldquo;Why do you hold to these denominational creeds? Sensible men are getting more liberal; they are removing the old landmarks: fall in with the times.&rdquo; Wear your shield, Christian, therefore, close upon your armour, and cry mightily unto God, that by his Spirit you may endure to the end.</p>
