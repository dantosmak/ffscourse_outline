<p id="d1016am-p3">In these words the believer is invited to a holy nearness to Jesus. &ldquo;Come and dine,&rdquo; implies the same table, the same meat; aye, and sometimes it means to sit side by side, and lean our head upon the Saviour&rsquo;s bosom. It is being brought into the banqueting-house, where waves the banner of redeeming love. &ldquo;Come and dine,&rdquo; gives us a vision of <em>union with Jesus</em>, because the only food that we can feast upon when we dine with Jesus is <em>himself</em>. Oh, what union is this! It is a depth which reason cannot fathom, that we thus feed upon Jesus. &ldquo;He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.&rdquo; It is also an invitation to enjoy <em>fellowship with </em><em>the saints</em>. Christians may differ on a variety of points, but they have all one spiritual appetite; and if we cannot all <em>feel</em> alike, we can all <em>feed</em> alike on the bread of life sent down from heaven. At the table of fellowship with Jesus we are one bread and one cup. As the loving cup goes round we pledge one another heartily therein. Get nearer to Jesus, and you will find yourself linked more and more in spirit to all who are like yourself, supported by the same heavenly manna. If we were more near to Jesus we should be more near to one another. We likewise see in these words the <em>source of strength</em> for every Christian. To look at Christ is to live, but for strength to serve him you must &ldquo;come and dine.&rdquo; We labour under much unnecessary weakness on account of neglecting this precept of the Master. We none of us need to put ourselves on low diet; on the contrary, we should fatten on the marrow and fatness of the gospel that we may accumulate strength therein, and urge every power to its full tension in the Master&rsquo;s service. Thus, then, if you would realize <em>nearness</em> to Jesus, <em>union</em> with Jesus, <em>love</em> to his people and <em>strength from Jesus</em>, &ldquo;come and dine&rdquo; with him by faith.</p>

<p id="d1016pm-p3">There are times in our spiritual experience when human counsel or sympathy, or religious ordinances, fail to comfort or help us. Why does our gracious God permit this? Perhaps it is because we have been living too much without him, and he therefore takes away everything upon which we have been in the habit of depending, that he may drive us to himself. It is a blessed thing to live at the fountain head. While our skin- bottles are full, we are content, like Hagar and Ishmael, to go into the wilderness; but when those are dry, nothing will serve us but &ldquo;Thou God seest me.&rdquo; We are like the prodigal, we love the swine-troughs and forget our Father&rsquo;s house. Remember, we can make swine-troughs and husks even out of the forms of religion; they are blessed things, but we may put them in God&rsquo;s place, and then they are of no value. Anything becomes an idol when it keeps us away from God: even the brazen serpent is to be despised as &ldquo;Nehushtan,&rdquo; if we worship it instead of God. The prodigal was never safer than when he was driven to his father&rsquo;s bosom, because he could find sustenance nowhere else. Our Lord favours us with a famine in the land that it may make us seek after himself the more. The best position for a Christian is living wholly and directly on God&rsquo;s grace—still abiding where he stood at first—&ldquo;Having nothing, and yet possessing all things.&rdquo; Let us never for a moment think that our standing is in our sanctification, our mortification, our graces, or our feelings, but know that because Christ offered a full atonement, therefore we are saved; for we are complete in him. Having nothing of our own to trust to, but resting upon the merits of Jesus—his passion and holy life furnish us with the only sure ground of confidence. Beloved, when we are brought to a thirsting condition, we are sure to turn to the fountain of life with eagerness.</p>
