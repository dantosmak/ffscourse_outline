<p id="d0403am-p3">He had been all night in agony, he had spent the early morning at the hall of Caiaphas, he had been hurried from Caiaphas to Pilate, from Pilate to Herod, and from Herod back again to Pilate; he had, therefore, but little strength left, and yet neither refreshment nor rest were permitted him. They were eager for his blood, and therefore led him out to die, loaded with the cross. O dolorous procession! Well may Salem&rsquo;s daughters weep. My soul, do thou weep also.</p>
<p id="d0403am-p4">What learn we here as we see our blessed Lord led forth? Do we not perceive that truth which was set forth in shadow by <em>the scapegoat</em>? Did not the high-priest bring the scapegoat, and put both his hands upon its head, confessing the sins of the people, that thus those sins might be laid upon the goat, and cease from the people? Then the goat was led away by a fit man into the wilderness, and it carried away the sins of the people, so that if they were sought for they could not be found. Now we see Jesus brought before the priests and rulers, who pronounce him guilty; God himself imputes our sins <em>to him</em>, &ldquo;the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all;&rdquo; &ldquo;He was made sin for us;&rdquo; and, as the substitute for our guilt, bearing our sin upon his shoulders, represented by the cross; we see the great Scapegoat led away by the appointed officers of justice. Beloved, can you feel assured that he carried <em>your</em> sin? As you look at the cross upon his shoulders, does it represent <em>your</em> sin? There is one way by which you can tell whether he carried your sin or not. Have you laid your hand upon his head, confessed your sin, and trusted in him? Then your sin lies not on you; it has all been transferred by blessed imputation to Christ, and he bears it on his shoulder as a load heavier than the cross.</p>
<p id="d0403am-p5">Let not the picture vanish till you have rejoiced in your own deliverance, and adored the loving Redeemer upon whom your iniquities were laid.</p>

<p id="d0403pm-p3">Here a confession of sin <em>common</em> to all the elect people of God. They have all fallen, and therefore, in common chorus, they all say, from the first who entered heaven to the last who shall enter there, &ldquo;All we like sheep have gone astray.&rdquo; The confession, while thus unanimous, is also <em>special</em> and particular: &ldquo;We have turned every one to his own way.&rdquo; There is a peculiar sinfulness about every one of the individuals; all are sinful, but each one with some special aggravation not found in his fellow. It is the mark of genuine repentance that while it naturally associates itself with other penitents, it also takes up a position of loneliness. &ldquo;We have turned every one to his own way,&rdquo; is a confession that each man had sinned against light peculiar to himself, or sinned with an aggravation which he could not perceive in others. This confession is <em>unreserved</em>; there is not a word to detract from its force, nor a syllable by way of excuse. The confession is <em>a giving up </em><em>of all pleas of self-righteousness</em>. It is the declaration of men who are consciously guilty—guilty with aggravations, guilty without excuse: they stand with their weapons of rebellion broken in pieces, and cry, &ldquo;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way.&rdquo; Yet we hear no dolorous wailings attending this confession of sin; for the next sentence makes it almost a song. &ldquo;The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.&rdquo; It is the most grievous sentence of the three, but it overflows with comfort. Strange is it that where misery was concentrated mercy reigned; where sorrow reached her climax weary souls find rest. The Saviour bruised is the healing of bruised hearts. See how the lowliest penitence gives place to assured confidence through simply gazing at Christ on the cross!</p>
