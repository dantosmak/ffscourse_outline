<p id="d0304am-p3">If none of God&rsquo;s saints were poor and tried, we should not know half so well the consolations of divine grace. When we find the wanderer who has not where to lay his head, who yet can say, &ldquo;Still will I trust in the Lord;&rdquo; when we see the pauper starving on bread and water, who still glories in Jesus; when we see the bereaved widow overwhelmed in affliction, and yet having faith in Christ, oh! what honour it reflects on the gospel. God&rsquo;s grace is illustrated and magnified in the poverty and trials of believers. Saints bear up under every discouragement, believing that all things work together for their good, and that out of apparent evils a real blessing shall ultimately spring—that their God will either work a deliverance for them speedily, or most assuredly support them in the trouble, as long as he is pleased to keep them in it. This patience of the saints proves the power of divine grace. There is a lighthouse out at sea: it is a calm night—I cannot tell whether the edifice is firm; the tempest must rage about it, and then I shall know whether it will stand. So with the Spirit&rsquo;s work: if it were not on many occasions surrounded with tempestuous waters, we should not know that it was true and strong; if the winds did not blow upon it, we should not know how firm and secure it was. The master-works of God are those men who stand in the midst of difficulties, stedfast, unmoveable,—</p>

<p id="d0304am-p4">He who would glorify his God must set his account upon meeting with many trials. No man can be illustrious before the Lord unless his conflicts be many. If then, yours be a much-tried path, rejoice in it, because you will the better show forth the all-sufficient grace of God. As for his failing you, never dream of it—hate the thought. The God who has been sufficient until now, should be trusted to the end.</p>

<p id="d0304pm-p3">Sheba&rsquo;s queen was amazed at the sumptuousness of Solomon&rsquo;s table. She lost all heart when she saw the provision of a single day; and she marvelled equally at the company of servants who were feasted at the royal board. But what is this to the hospitalities of the God of grace? Ten thousand thousand of his people are daily fed; hungry and thirsty, they bring large appetites with them to the banquet, but not one of them returns unsatisfied; there is enough for each, enough for all, enough for evermore. Though the host that feed at Jehovah&rsquo;s table is countless as the stars of heaven, yet each one has his portion of meat. Think how much grace one saint requires, so much that nothing but the Infinite could supply him for one day; and yet the Lord spreads his table, not for one, but many saints, not for one day, but for many years; not for many years only, but for generation after generation. Observe the full feasting spoken of in the text, the guests at mercy&rsquo;s banquet are satisfied, nay, more &ldquo;abundantly satisfied;&rdquo; and that not with ordinary fare, but with fatness, the peculiar fatness of God&rsquo;s own house; and such feasting is guaranteed by a faithful promise to all those children of men who put their trust under the shadow of Jehovah&rsquo;s wings. I once thought if I might but get the broken meat at God&rsquo;s back door of grace I should be satisfied; like the woman who said, &ldquo;The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master&rsquo;s table;&rdquo; but no child of God is ever served with scraps and leavings; like Mephibosheth, they all eat from the king&rsquo;s own table. In matters of grace, we all have Benjamin&rsquo;s mess—we all have ten times more than we could have expected, and though our necessities are great, yet are we often amazed at the marvellous plenty of grace which God gives us experimentally to enjoy.</p>
