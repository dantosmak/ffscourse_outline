<p id="d0401am-p3">For several days we have been dwelling upon the Saviour&rsquo;s passion, and for some little time to come we shall linger there. In beginning a new month, let us seek the same desires after our Lord as those which glowed in the heart of the elect spouse. See how she leaps at once to <em>him</em>; there are no prefatory words; she does not even mention his name; she is in the heart of her theme at once, for she speaks of<em>him</em> who was the only him in the world to her. How bold is her love! It was much condescension which permitted the weeping penitent to anoint his feet with spikenard—it was rich love which allowed the gentle Mary to sit at his feet and learn of him—but here, love, strong, fervent love, aspires to higher tokens of regard, and closer signs of fellowship. Esther trembled in the presence of Ahasuerus, but the spouse in joyful liberty of perfect love knows no fear. If we have received the same free spirit, we also may ask the like. By kisses we suppose to be intended those varied manifestations of affection by which the believer is made to enjoy the love of Jesus. The kiss of<em>reconciliation</em> we enjoyed at our conversion, and it was sweet as honey dropping from the comb. The kiss of <em>acceptance</em> is still warm on our brow, as we know that he hath accepted our persons and our works through rich grace. The kiss of daily, present <em>communion</em> is that which we pant after to be repeated day after day, till it is changed into the kiss of <em>reception</em>, which removes the soul from earth, and the kiss of<em>consummation</em> which fills it with the joy of heaven. Faith is our walk, but fellowship sensibly felt is our rest. Faith is the road, but communion with Jesus is the well from which the pilgrim drinks. O lover of our souls, be not strange to us; let the lips of thy blessing meet the lips of our asking; let the lips of thy fulness touch the lips of our need, and straightway the kiss will be effected.</p>

<p id="d0401pm-p3">This month of April is said to derive its name from the Latin verb <em>aperio</em>, which signifies <em>to open</em>, because all the buds and blossoms are now opening, and we have arrived at the gates of the flowery year. Reader, if you are yet unsaved, may your heart, in accord with the universal awakening of nature, be opened to receive the Lord. Every blossoming flower warns you that <em>it is time to seek the Lord</em>; be not out of tune with nature, but let your heart bud and bloom with holy desires. Do you tell me that the warm blood of youth leaps in your veins? then, I entreat you, give your vigour to the Lord. It was my unspeakable happiness to be called in early youth, and I could fain praise the Lord every day for it. Salvation is priceless, let it come when it may, but oh! an early salvation has a double value in it. Young men and maidens, since you may perish ere you reach your prime, &ldquo;<em>It is time to seek the Lord</em>.&rdquo; Ye who feel the first signs of decay, quicken your pace: that hollow cough, that hectic flush, are warnings which you must not trifle with; with you <em>it is indeed time to seek the Lord</em>. Did I observe a little grey mingled with your once luxurious tresses? Years are stealing on apace, and death is drawing nearer by hasty marches, let each return of spring arouse you to set your house in order. Dear reader, if you are now advanced in life, let me entreat and implore you to delay no longer. There is a day of grace for you now—be thankful for that, but it is a limited season and grows shorter every time that clock ticks. Here in this silent chamber, on this first night of another month, I speak to you as best I can by paper and ink, and from my inmost soul, as God&rsquo;s servant, I lay before you this warning, &ldquo;<em>It is time to seek </em><em>the Lord</em>.&rdquo; Slight not that work, it may be your last call from destruction, the final syllable from the lip of grace.</p>
