<p id="d0115am-p3">God&rsquo;s promises were never meant to be thrown aside as waste paper; he intended that they should be used. God&rsquo;s gold is not miser&rsquo;s money, but is minted to be traded with. Nothing pleases our Lord better than to see his promises put in circulation; he loves to see his children bring them up to him, and say, &ldquo;Lord, do as thou hast said.&rdquo; We glorify God when we plead his promises. Do you think that God will be any the poorer for giving you the riches he has promised? Do you dream that he will be any the less holy for giving holiness to you? Do you imagine he will be any the less pure for washing you from your sins? He has said &ldquo;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&rdquo; Faith lays hold upon the promise of pardon, and it does not delay, saying, &ldquo;This is a precious promise, I wonder if it be true?&rdquo; but it goes straight to the throne with it, and pleads, &ldquo;Lord, here is the promise, &lsquo;Do as thou hast said.&rsquo;&rdquo; Our Lord replies, &ldquo;Be it unto thee even as thou wilt.&rdquo; When a Christian grasps a promise, if he does not take it to God, he dishonours him; but when he hastens to the throne of grace, and cries, &ldquo;Lord, I have nothing to recommend me but this, &lsquo;Thou hast said it;&rsquo;&rdquo; then his desire shall be granted. Our heavenly Banker delights to cash his own notes. Never let the promise rust. Draw the sword of promise out of its scabbard, and use it with holy violence. Think not that God will be troubled by your importunately reminding him of his promises. He loves to hear the loud outcries of needy souls. It is his delight to bestow favours. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun is not weary of shining, nor the fountain of flowing. It is God&rsquo;s nature to keep his promises; therefore go at once to the throne with &ldquo;Do as thou hast said.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0115pm-p3">Lying tongues were busy against the reputation of David, but he did not defend himself; he moved the case into a higher court, and pleaded before the great King himself. Prayer is the safest method of replying to words of hatred. The Psalmist prayed in no cold-hearted manner, he gave himself to the exercise—threw his whole soul and heart into it—straining every sinew and muscle, as Jacob did when wrestling with the angel. Thus, and thus only, shall any of us speed at the throne of grace. As a shadow has no power because there is no substance in it, even so that supplication, in which a man&rsquo;s proper self is not thoroughly present in agonizing earnestness and vehement desire, is utterly ineffectual, for it lacks that which would give it force. &ldquo;Fervent prayer,&rdquo; says an old divine, &ldquo;like a cannon planted at the gates of heaven, makes them fly open.&rdquo; The common fault with the most of us is our readiness to yield to distractions. Our thoughts go roving hither and thither, and we make little progress towards our desired end. Like quicksilver our mind will not hold together, but rolls off this way and that. How great an evil this is! It injures us, and what is worse, it insults our God. What should we think of a petitioner, if, while having an audience with a prince, he should be playing with a feather or catching a fly?</p>
<p id="d0115pm-p4">Continuance and perseverance are intended in the expression of our text. David did not cry once, and then relapse into silence; his holy clamour was continued till it brought down the blessing. Prayer must not be our chance work, but our daily business, our habit and vocation. As artists give themselves to their models, and poets to their classical pursuits, so must we addict ourselves to prayer. We must be immersed in prayer as in our element, and so pray without ceasing. Lord, teach us so to pray that we may be more and more prevalent in supplication.</p>
