<p id="d1020am-p3">Many Christians remain stunted and dwarfed in spiritual things, so as to present the same appearance year after year. No up-springing of advanced and refined feeling is manifest in them. They exist but do not &ldquo;<em>grow up into him in all </em><em>things</em>.&rdquo; But should we rest content with being in the &ldquo;green blade,&rdquo; when we might advance to &ldquo;the ear,&rdquo; and eventually ripen into the &ldquo;full corn in the ear?&rdquo; Should we be satisfied to believe in Christ, and to say, &ldquo;I am safe,&rdquo; without wishing to know in our own experience more of the fulness which is to be found in him. It should not be so; we should, as good traders in heaven&rsquo;s market, covet to be enriched in the knowledge of Jesus. It is all very well to keep other men&rsquo;s vineyards, but we must not neglect our own spiritual growth and ripening. Why should it always be winter time in our hearts? We must have our seed time, it is true, but O for a spring time—yea, a summer season, which shall give promise of an early harvest. If we would ripen in grace, we must live near to Jesus—in his presence—ripened by the sunshine of his smiles. We must hold sweet communion with him. We must leave the distant view of his face and come near, as John did, and pillow our head on his breast; then shall we find ourselves advancing in holiness, in love, in faith, in hope—yea, in every precious gift. As the sun rises first on mountain-tops and gilds them with his light, and presents one of the most charming sights to the eye of the traveller; so is it one of the most delightful contemplations in the world to mark the glow of the Spirit&rsquo;s light on the head of some saint, who has risen up in spiritual stature, like Saul, above his fellows, till, like a mighty Alp, snow-capped, he reflects first among the chosen, the beams of the Sun of Righteousness, and bears the sheen of his effulgence high aloft for all to see, and seeing it, to glorify his Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p id="d1020pm-p3">Although this message was sent to the south, and referred to the seed of Israel, it may profitably be a summons to ourselves. Backward we are naturally to all good things, and it is a lesson of grace to learn to go forward in the ways of God. Reader, are you unconverted, but do you desire to trust in the Lord Jesus? Then <em>keep not back</em>. Love invites you, the promises secure you success, the precious blood prepares the way. Let not sins or fears hinder you, but come to Jesus just as you are. Do you long to pray? Would you pour out your heart before the Lord? <em>Keep not back</em>. The mercy-seat is prepared for such as need mercy; a sinner&rsquo;s cries will prevail with God. You are invited, nay, you are commanded to pray; come therefore with boldness to the throne of grace.</p>
<p id="d1020pm-p4">Dear friend, are you already saved? Then <em>keep not back</em> from union with the Lord&rsquo;s people. Neglect not the ordinances of baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. You may be of a timid disposition, but you must strive against it, lest it lead you into disobedience. There is a sweet promise made to those who confess Christ—by no means miss it, lest you come under the condemnation of those who deny him. If you have talents <em>keep </em><em>not back</em> from using them. Hoard not your wealth, waste not your time; let not your abilities rust or your influence be unused. Jesus kept not back; imitate him by being foremost in self-denials and self-sacrifices. <em>Keep not back</em> from close communion with God, from boldly appropriating covenant blessings, from advancing in the divine life, from prying into the precious mysteries of the love of Christ. Neither, beloved friend, be guilty of keeping others back by your coldness, harshness, or suspicions. For Jesus&rsquo; sake go forward yourself, and encourage others to do the like. Hell and the leaguered bands of superstition and infidelity are forward to the fight. O soldiers of the cross, keep not back.</p>
