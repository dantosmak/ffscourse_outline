<p id="d0712am-p4">Mark the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their gracious acts. How unwisely do those believers talk who make preferences in the Persons of the Trinity; who think of Jesus as if he were the embodiment of everything lovely and gracious, while the Father they regard as severely just, but destitute of kindness. Equally wrong are those who magnify the decree of the Father, and the atonement of the Son, so as to depreciate the work of the Spirit. In deeds of grace none of the Persons of the Trinity act apart from the rest. They are as united in their deeds as in their essence. In their love towards the chosen they are one, and in the actions which flow from that great central source they are still undivided. Specially notice this in the matter of sanctification. While we may without mistake speak of sanctification as the work of the Spirit, yet we must take heed that we do not view it as if the Father and the Son had no part therein. It is correct to speak of sanctification as the work of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Still doth Jehovah say, &ldquo;Let <em>us</em> make man in our own image after our likeness,&rdquo; and thus we are &ldquo;<em>his</em> workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.&rdquo; See the value which God sets upon real holiness, since the Three Persons in the Trinity are represented as co-working to produce a Church without &ldquo;spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.&rdquo; And you, believer, as the follower of Christ, must also set a high value on holiness—upon purity of life and godliness of conversation. Value the blood of Christ as the foundation of your hope, but never speak disparagingly of the work of the Spirit which is your meetness for the inheritance of the saints in light. This day let us so live as to manifest the work of the Triune God in us.</p>

<p id="d0712pm-p3">Yonder city of the great King is a place of <em>active </em><em>service</em>. Ransomed spirits serve him day and night in his temple. They never cease to fulfil the good pleasure of their King. They always &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; so far as ease and freedom from care is concerned; and never &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; in the sense of indolence or inactivity. Jerusalem the golden is the place of <em>communion</em> with all the people of God. We shall sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in eternal fellowship. We shall hold high converse with the noble host of the elect, all reigning with him who by his love and his potent arm has brought them safely home. We shall not sing solos, but in chorus shall we praise our King. Heaven is a place of <em>victory realized</em>. Whenever, Christian, thou hast achieved a victory over thy lusts—whenever after hard struggling, thou hast laid a temptation dead at thy feet—thou hast in that hour a foretaste of the joy that awaits thee when the Lord shall shortly tread Satan under thy feet, and thou shalt find thyself more than conqueror through him who hath loved thee. Paradise is a place of <em>security</em>. When you enjoy the full assurance of faith, you have the pledge of that glorious security which shall be yours when you are a perfect citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem. O my sweet home, Jerusalem, thou happy harbour of my soul! Thanks, even now, to him whose love hath taught me to long for thee; but louder thanks in eternity, when I shall possess thee.</p>
