<p id="d0811am-p3">Numbers of Christians can view the past with pleasure, but regard the present with dissatisfaction; they look back upon the days which they have passed in communing with the Lord as being the sweetest and the best they have ever known, but as to the present, it is clad in a sable garb of gloom and dreariness. Once they lived near to Jesus, but now they feel that they have wandered from him, and they say, &ldquo;O that I were as in months past!&rdquo; They complain that they have lost their evidences, or that they have not present peace of mind, or that they have no enjoyment in the means of grace, or that conscience is not so tender, or that they have not so much zeal for God&rsquo;s glory. The causes of this mournful state of things are manifold. It may arise through a comparative <em>neglect of prayer</em>, for a neglected closet is the beginning of all spiritual decline. Or it may be the result of <em>idolatry</em>. The heart has been occupied with something else, more than with God; the affections have been set on the things of earth, instead of the things of heaven. A jealous God will not be content with a divided heart; he must be loved first and best. He will withdraw the sunshine of his presence from a cold, wandering heart. Or the cause may be found in<em>self-confidence</em> and <em>self-righteousness</em>. Pride is busy in the heart, and self is exalted instead of lying low at the foot of the cross. Christian, if you are not now as you &ldquo;were in months past,&rdquo; do not rest satisfied with <em>wishing</em> for a return of former happiness, but go at once to seek your Master, and tell him your sad state. Ask his grace and strength to help you to walk more closely with him; humble yourself before him, and he will lift you up, and give you yet again to enjoy the light of his countenance. Do not sit down to sigh and lament; while the beloved Physician lives there is hope, nay there is a certainty of recovery for the worst cases.</p>

<p id="d0811pm-p3">&ldquo;Consolation.&rdquo; There is music in the word: like David&rsquo;s harp, it charms away the evil spirit of melancholy. It was a distinguished honour to Barnabas to be called &ldquo;the son of consolation&rdquo;; nay, it is one of the illustrious names of a greater than Barnabas, for the Lord Jesus is &ldquo;the consolation of Israel.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Everlasting</em> consolation&rdquo;—here is the cream of all, for the eternity of comfort is the crown and glory of it. What is this &ldquo;everlasting consolation&rdquo;? It includes a sense of pardoned sin. A Christian man has received in his heart the witness of the Spirit that his iniquities are put away like a cloud, and his transgressions like a thick cloud. If sin be pardoned, is not that an everlasting consolation? Next, the Lord gives his people an abiding sense of acceptance in Christ. The Christian knows that God looks upon him as standing in union with Jesus. Union to the risen Lord is a consolation of the most abiding order; it is, in fact, everlasting. Let sickness prostrate us, have we not seen hundreds of believers as happy in the weakness of disease as they would have been in the strength of hale and blooming health? Let death&rsquo;s arrows pierce us to the heart, our comfort dies not, for have not our ears full often heard the songs of saints as they have rejoiced because the living love of God was shed abroad in their hearts in dying moments? Yes, a sense of acceptance in the Beloved is an everlasting consolation. Moreover, the Christian has a conviction of his security. God has promised to save those who trust in Christ: the Christian does trust in Christ, and he believes that God will be as good as his word, and will save him. He feels that he is safe by virtue of his being bound up with the person and work of Jesus.</p>
