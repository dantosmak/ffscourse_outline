<p id="d0104am-p3">&ldquo;Grow in grace&rdquo;—not in one grace only, but in <em>all</em> grace. Grow in that root-grace, <em>faith</em>. Believe the promises more firmly than you have done. Let faith increase in fulness, constancy, simplicity. Grow also in <em>love</em>. Ask that your love may become extended, more intense, more practical, influencing every thought, word, and deed. Grow likewise in <em>humility</em>. Seek to lie very low, and know more of your own nothingness. As you grow <em>downward</em> in humility, seek also to grow <em>upward</em>—having nearer approaches to God in prayer and more intimate fellowship with Jesus. May God the Holy Spirit enable you to &ldquo;<em>grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</em>.&rdquo; He who grows not in the knowledge of Jesus, refuses to be blessed. To know him is &ldquo;life eternal,&rdquo; and to advance in the knowledge of him is to increase in happiness. He who does not long to know more of Christ, knows nothing of him yet. Whoever hath sipped this wine will thirst for more, for although Christ doth satisfy, yet it is such a satisfaction, that the appetite is not cloyed, but whetted. If you know the love of Jesus—as the hart panteth for the water-brooks, so will you pant after deeper draughts of his love. If you do not desire to know him better, then you love him not, for love always cries, &ldquo;Nearer, nearer.&rdquo; Absence from Christ is hell; but the presence of Jesus is heaven. Rest not then content without an increasing acquaintance with Jesus. Seek to know more of him in his divine nature, in his human relationship, in his finished work, in his death, in his resurrection, in his present glorious intercession, and in his future royal advent. Abide hard by the Cross, and search the mystery of his wounds. An increase of love to Jesus, and a more perfect apprehension of his love to us is one of the best tests of growth in grace.</p>

<p id="d0104pm-p3">This morning our desires went forth for growth in our acquaintance with the Lord Jesus; it may be well tonight to consider a kindred topic, namely, <em>our heavenly Joseph's </em><em>knowledge of us</em>. This was most blessedly perfect long before we had the slightest knowledge of him. &ldquo;His eyes beheld our substance, yet being imperfect, and in his book all our members were written, when as yet there was none of them.&rdquo; Before we had a being in the world we had a being in his heart. When we were enemies to him, he knew us, our misery, our madness, and our wickedness. When we wept bitterly in despairing repentance, and viewed him only as a judge and a ruler, he viewed us as his brethren well beloved, and his bowels yearned towards us. He never mistook his chosen, but always beheld them as objects of his infinite affection. &ldquo;The Lord knoweth them that are his,&rdquo; is as true of the prodigals who are feeding swine as of the children who sit at the table.</p>
<p id="d0104pm-p4">But, alas! <em>we knew not our royal Brother</em>, and out of this ignorance grew a host of sins. We withheld our hearts from him, and allowed him no entrance to our love. We mistrusted him, and gave no credit to his words. We rebelled against him, and paid him no loving homage. The Sun of Righteousness shone forth, and we could not see him. Heaven came down to earth, and earth perceived it not. Let God be praised, those days are over with us; yet even now it is but little that we know of Jesus compared with what he knows of us. We have but begun to study him, but he knoweth us altogether. It is a blessed circumstance that the ignorance is not on his side, for then it would be a hopeless case for us. He will not say to us, &ldquo;I never knew you,&rdquo; but he will confess our names in the day of his appearing, and meanwhile will manifest himself to us as he doth not unto the world.</p>
