<p id="d1011am-p3">The act of prayer <em>teaches us our unworthiness</em>, which is a very salutary lesson for such proud beings as we are. If God gave us favours without constraining us to pray for them we should never know how poor we are, but a true prayer is an inventory of wants, a catalogue of necessities, a revelation of hidden poverty. While it is an application to divine wealth, it is a confession of human emptiness. The most healthy state of a Christian is to be always empty in self and constantly depending upon the Lord for supplies; to be always poor in self and rich in Jesus; weak as water personally, but mighty through God to do great exploits; and hence the use of prayer, because, while it adores God, it lays the creature where it should be, in the very dust. Prayer is in itself, apart from the answer which it brings, a great benefit to the Christian. As the runner gains strength for the race by daily exercise, so for the great race of life we acquire energy by the hallowed labour of prayer. Prayer plumes the wings of God&rsquo;s young eaglets, that they may learn to mount above the clouds. Prayer girds the loins of God&rsquo;s warriors, and sends them forth to combat with their sinews braced and their muscles firm. An earnest pleader cometh out of his closet, even as the sun ariseth from the chambers of the east, rejoicing like a strong man to run his race. Prayer is that uplifted hand of Moses which routs the Amalekites more than the sword of Joshua; it is the arrow shot from the chamber of the prophet foreboding defeat to the Syrians. Prayer girds human weakness with divine strength, turns human folly into heavenly wisdom, and gives to troubled mortals the peace of God. We know not what prayer cannot do! We thank thee, great God, for the mercy-seat, a choice proof of thy marvellous lovingkindness. Help us to use it aright throughout this day!</p>

<p id="d1011pm-p3">In the second epistle to Timothy, first chapter, and ninth verse, are these words—&ldquo;Who hath saved us, and called us with an <em>holy</em>calling.&rdquo; Now, here is a touchstone by which we may try our calling. It is &ldquo;an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace.&rdquo; This calling forbids all trust in our own doings, and conducts us to Christ alone for salvation, but it afterwards purges us from dead works to serve the living and true God. As he that hath called you is holy, so must you be holy. If you are living in sin, you are not called, but if you are truly Christ's, you can say, &ldquo;Nothing pains me so much as sin; I desire to be rid of it; Lord, help me to be holy.&rdquo; Is this the panting of thy heart? Is this the tenor of thy life towards God, and his divine will? Again, in <a id="d1011pm-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Philippians_3:13-14" onclick="return goBible('nt','Phil','3','13','3','14');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Phil 3:13 - 3:14')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Phil_3_13_3_14">Philippians, 3:13, 14</a>, we are told of &ldquo;The <em>high</em> calling of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Is then your calling a high calling? Has it ennobled your heart, and set it upon heavenly things? Has it elevated your hopes, your tastes, your desires? Has it upraised the constant tenor of your life, so that you spend it with God and for God? Another test we find in <a id="d1011pm-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Hebrews_3:1" onclick="return goBible('nt','Heb','3','1','3','1');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Heb 3:1 - 3:1')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Heb_3_1_0_0">Hebrews 3:1</a>—&ldquo;Partakers of the <em>heavenly</em> calling.&rdquo; Heavenly calling means a call <em>from</em> heaven. If man alone call thee, thou art uncalled. Is thy calling of God? Is it a call <em>to</em> heaven as well as from heaven? Unless thou art a stranger here, and heaven thy home, thou hast not been called with a heavenly calling; for those who have been so called, declare that they look for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God, and they themselves are strangers and pilgrims upon the earth. Is thy calling thus holy, high, heavenly? Then, beloved, thou hast been called of God, for such is the calling wherewith God doth call his people.</p>
