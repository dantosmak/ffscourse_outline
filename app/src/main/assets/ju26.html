<p id="d0726am-p3">If thou wouldest enjoy the eminent grace of the full assurance of faith, under the blessed Spirit&rsquo;s influence, and assistance, do what the Scripture tells thee, &ldquo;<em>Give </em><em>diligence</em>.&rdquo; Take care that thy <em>faith</em> is of the right kind—that it is not a mere belief of doctrine, but a simple faith, depending on Christ, and on Christ alone. Give diligent heed to thy <em>courage</em>. Plead with God that he would give thee the face of a lion, that thou mayest, with a consciousness of right, go on boldly. Study well the Scriptures, and get <em>knowledge</em>; for a knowledge of doctrine will tend very much to confirm faith. Try to understand God&rsquo;s Word; let it dwell in thy heart richly.</p>
<p id="d0726am-p4">When thou hast done this, &ldquo;Add to thy knowledge <em>temperance</em>.&rdquo; Take heed to thy body: be temperate without. Take heed to thy soul: be temperate within. Get temperance of lip, life, heart, and thought. Add to this, by God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit, <em>patience</em>; ask him to give thee that patience which endureth affliction, which, when it is tried, shall come forth as gold. Array yourself with patience, that you may not murmur nor be depressed in your afflictions. When that grace is won look to <em>godliness</em>. Godliness is something more than religion. Make God&rsquo;s glory your object in life; live in his sight; dwell close to him; seek for fellowship with him; and thou hast &ldquo;godliness&rdquo;; and to that add <em>brotherly love</em>. Have a love to all the saints: and add to that a <em>charity</em>, which openeth its arms to all men, and loves their souls. When you are adorned with these jewels, and just in proportion as you practise these heavenly virtues, will you come to know by clearest evidence &ldquo;your calling and election.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give diligence,&rdquo; if you would get assurance, for lukewarmness and doubting very naturally go hand in hand.</p>

<p align="center" id="d0726pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;That he may set him with princes.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3 align="center" id="d0726pm-p2.2"><a id="d0726pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Psalms_113:8" onclick="return goBible('ot','Ps','113','8','113','8');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Ps 113:8 - 113:8')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Ps_113_8_0_0">Psalm 113:8</a></h3>
<p id="d0726pm-p3">Our spiritual privileges are of the highest order. &ldquo;Among princes&rdquo; <em>is the place of select society</em>. &ldquo;Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Speak of select society, there is none like this! &ldquo;We are a chosen generation, a peculiar people, a royal priesthood.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are come unto the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.&rdquo; The saints <em>have courtly </em><em>audience</em>: princes have admittance to royalty when common people must stand afar off. The child of God has free access to the inner courts of heaven. &ldquo;For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us come boldly,&rdquo; says the apostle, &ldquo;<em>to the throne</em> of the heavenly grace.&rdquo; Among princes there is <em>abundant wealth</em>, but what is the abundance of princes compared with the riches of believers? for &ldquo;all things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.&rdquo; &ldquo;He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?&rdquo; Princes have <em>peculiar power</em>. A prince of heaven&rsquo;s empire has great influence: he wields a sceptre in his own domain; he sits upon Jesus&rsquo; throne, for &ldquo;He hath made us kings and priests unto God, and we shall reign forever and ever.&rdquo; We reign over the united kingdom of time and eternity. Princes, again, have <em>special </em><em>honour</em>. We may look down upon all earth-born dignity from the eminence upon which grace has placed us. For what is human grandeur to this, &ldquo;He hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus&rdquo;? We share the honour of Christ, and compared with this, earthly splendours are not worth a thought. Communion with Jesus is a richer gem than ever glittered in imperial diadem. Union with the Lord is a coronet of beauty outshining all the blaze of imperial pomp.</p>
