<p id="d0421am-p3">The marrow of Job&rsquo;s comfort lies in that little word &ldquo;My&rdquo;—&ldquo;My Redeemer,&rdquo; and in the fact that the Redeemer lives. Oh! to get hold of a living Christ. We must get a property in him before we can enjoy him. What is gold in the mine to me? Men are beggars in Peru, and beg their bread in California. It is gold in my purse which will satisfy my necessities, by purchasing the bread I need. So a Redeemer who does not redeem <em>me</em>, an avenger who will never stand up for <em>my</em> blood, of what avail were such? Rest not content until by faith you can say &ldquo;Yes, I cast myself upon my living Lord; and he is mine.&rdquo; It may be you hold him with a feeble hand; you half think it presumption to say, &ldquo;He lives as <em>my</em> Redeemer;&rdquo; yet, remember if you have but faith as a grain of mustard seed, that little faith <em>entitles</em> you to say it. But there is also another word here, expressive of Job&rsquo;s strong confidence, &ldquo;<em>I know</em>.&rdquo; To say, &ldquo;I hope so, I trust so&rdquo; is comfortable; and there are thousands in the fold of Jesus who hardly ever get much further. But to reach the essence of consolation you must say, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Ifs, buts, and perhapses, are sure murderers of peace and comfort. Doubts are dreary things in times of sorrow. Like wasps they sting the soul! If I have any suspicion that Christ is not mine, then there is vinegar mingled with the gall of death; but if I know that Jesus lives for me, then darkness is not dark: even the night is light about me. Surely if Job, in those ages before the coming and advent of Christ, could say, &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; <em>we</em> should not speak less positively. God forbid that our positiveness should be presumption. Let us see that our evidences are right, lest we build upon an ungrounded hope; and then let us not be satisfied with the mere foundation, for it is from the upper rooms that we get the widest prospect. A living Redeemer, truly mine, is joy unspeakable.</p>

<p id="d0421pm-p3">He who was once despised and rejected of men, now occupies the honourable position of a beloved and honoured Son. The right hand of God is <em>the place of majesty and favour</em>. Our Lord Jesus is his people&rsquo;s representative. When he died for them, they had rest; he rose again for them, they had liberty; when he sat down at his Father&rsquo;s right hand, they had favour, and honour, and dignity. The raising and elevation of Christ is the elevation, the acceptance, and enshrinement, the glorifying of all his people, for he is their head and representative. This sitting at the right hand of God, then, is to be viewed as the acceptance of the person of the Surety, the reception of the Representative, and therefore, the acceptance of <em>our</em> souls. O saint, see in this thy sure freedom from condemnation. &ldquo;Who is he that condemneth?&rdquo; Who shall condemn the men who are in Jesus at the right hand of God?</p>
<p id="d0421pm-p4">The right hand is <em>the place of power</em>. Christ at the right hand of God hath all power in heaven and in earth. Who shall fight against the people who have such power vested in their Captain? O my soul, what can destroy thee if Omnipotence be thy helper? If the aegis of the Almighty cover thee, what sword can smite thee? Rest thou secure. If Jesus is thine all-prevailing King, and hath trodden thine enemies beneath his feet; if sin, death, and hell are all vanquished by him, and thou art represented in him, by no possibility canst thou be destroyed.</p>
