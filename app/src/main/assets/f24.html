<p id="d0224am-p3">Here is <em>sovereign mercy</em>—&ldquo;I will give them the shower in its season.&rdquo; Is it not sovereign, <em>divine</em> mercy?—for who can say, &ldquo;I will give them showers,&rdquo; except God? There is only one voice which can speak to the clouds, and bid them beget the rain. Who sendeth down the rain upon the earth? Who scattereth the showers upon the green herb? Do not I, the Lord? So grace is the gift of God, and is not to be created by man. It is also <em>needed</em> grace. What would the ground do without showers? You may break the clods, you may sow your seeds, but what can you do without the rain? As absolutely needful is the divine blessing. In vain you labour, until God the plenteous shower bestows, and sends salvation down. Then, it is <em>plenteous grace</em>. &ldquo;I will send them showers.&rdquo; It does not say, &ldquo;I will send them drops,&rdquo; but &ldquo;showers.&rdquo; So it is with grace. If God gives a blessing, he usually gives it in such a measure that there is not room enough to receive it. Plenteous grace! Ah! we want plenteous grace to keep us humble, to make us prayerful, to make us holy; plenteous grace to make us zealous, to preserve us through this life, and at last to land us in heaven. We cannot do without saturating showers of grace. Again, it is<em>seasonable grace</em>. &ldquo;I will cause the shower to come down <em>in his season</em>.&rdquo; What is thy season this morning? Is it the season of drought? Then that is the season for showers. Is it a season of great heaviness and black clouds? Then that is the season for showers. &ldquo;As thy days so shall thy strength be.&rdquo; And here is a <em>varied</em> blessing. &ldquo;I will give thee <em>showers</em> of blessing.&rdquo; The word is in the plural. All kinds of blessings God will send. All God&rsquo;s blessings go together, like links in a golden chain. If he gives converting grace, he will also give comforting grace. He will send &ldquo;showers of blessing.&rdquo; Look up today, O parched plant, and open thy leaves and flowers for a heavenly watering.</p>

<p id="d0224pm-p3">What a sweet answer to an anxious enquiry! This night let us rejoice in it. O Zion, there are good things in store for thee; thy time of travail shall soon be over; thy children shall be brought forth; thy captivity shall end. Bear patiently the rod for a season, and under the darkness still trust in God, for his love burneth towards thee. God loves the church with a love too deep for human imagination: he loves her with all his infinite heart. Therefore let her sons be of good courage; she cannot be far from prosperity to whom God speaketh &ldquo;good words and comfortable words.&rdquo; What these comfortable words are the prophet goes on to tell us: &ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.&rdquo; The Lord loves his church so much that he cannot bear that she should go astray to others; and when she has done so, he cannot endure that she should suffer too much or too heavily. He will not have his enemies afflict her: he is displeased with them because they increase her misery. When God seems most to leave his church, his heart is warm towards her. History shows that whenever God uses a rod to chasten his servants, he always breaks it afterwards, as if he loathed the rod which gave his children pain. &ldquo;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.&rdquo; God hath not forgotten us because he smites—his blows are no evidences of want of love. If this is true of his church <em>collectively</em>, it is of necessity true also of <em>each individual member</em>. You may fear that the Lord has passed you by, but it is not so: he who counts the stars, and calls them by their names, is in no danger of forgetting his own children. He knows your case as thoroughly as if you were the only creature he ever made, or the only saint he ever loved. Approach him and be at peace.</p>
