<p id="d0919am-p3">This &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; makes us free to heaven&rsquo;s charter—<em>the </em><em>Bible</em>. Here is a choice passage, believer, &ldquo;When thou passest through the rivers, I will be with thee.&rdquo; You are free to that. Here is another: &ldquo;The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee&rdquo;; you are free to that. You are a welcome guest at the table of the promises. Scripture is a never-failing treasury filled with boundless stores of grace. It is the bank of heaven; you may draw from it as much as you please, without let or hindrance. Come in faith and you are welcome to all <em>covenant blessings</em>. There is not a promise in the Word which shall be withheld. In the depths of tribulations let this freedom comfort you; amidst waves of distress let it cheer you; when sorrows surround thee let it be thy solace. This is thy Father&rsquo;s love-token; thou art free to it at all times. Thou art also <em>free to the throne of </em><em>grace</em>. It is the believer&rsquo;s privilege to have access at all times to his heavenly Father. Whatever our desires, our difficulties, our wants, we are at liberty to spread all before him. It matters not how much we may have sinned, we may ask and expect pardon. It signifies nothing how poor we are, we may plead his promise that he will provide all things needful. We have permission to approach his throne at all times—in midnight&rsquo;s darkest hour, or in noontide&rsquo;s most burning heat. Exercise thy right, O believer, and live up to thy privilege. Thou art free to all that is treasured up <em>in Christ</em>—wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It matters not what thy need is, for there is fulness of supply in Christ, and it is there <em>for thee</em>. O what a &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; is thine! freedom from condemnation, freedom to the promises, freedom to the throne of grace, and at last freedom to enter heaven!</p>

<p id="d0919pm-p3">Devout souls delight to look upon those mercies which they have obtained in answer to supplication, for they can see God&rsquo;s especial love in them. When we can name our blessings Samuel, that is, &ldquo;asked of God,&rdquo; they will be as dear to us as her child was to Hannah. Peninnah had many children, but they came as common blessings unsought in prayer: Hannah&rsquo;s one heaven-given child was dearer far, because he was the fruit of earnest pleadings. How sweet was that water to Samson which he found at &ldquo;the well of him that prayed!&rdquo; Quassia cups turn all waters bitter, but the cup of prayer puts a sweetness into the draughts it brings. Did we pray for the conversion of our children? How doubly sweet, when they are saved, to see in them our own petitions fulfilled! Better to rejoice over them as the fruit of our pleadings than as the fruit of our bodies. Have we sought of the Lord some choice spiritual gift? When it comes to us it will be wrapped up in the gold cloth of God&rsquo;s faithfulness and truth, and so be doubly precious. Have we petitioned for success in the Lord&rsquo;s work? How joyful is the prosperity which comes flying upon the wings of prayer! It is always best to get blessings into our house in the legitimate way, by the door of prayer; then they are blessings indeed, and not temptations. Even when prayer speeds not, the blessings grow all the richer for the delay; the child Jesus was all the more lovely in the eyes of Mary when she found him after having sought him sorrowing. That which we win by prayer we should dedicate to God, as Hannah dedicated Samuel. The gift came from heaven, let it go to heaven. Prayer brought it, gratitude sang over it, let devotion consecrate it. Here will be a special occasion for saying, &ldquo;Of thine own have I given unto thee.&rdquo; Reader, is prayer your element or your weariness? Which?</p>
