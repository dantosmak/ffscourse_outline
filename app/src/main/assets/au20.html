<p id="d0820am-p3">Among all the saints whose lives are recorded in Holy Writ, David possesses an experience of the most striking, varied, and instructive character. In his history we meet with trials and temptations not to be discovered, as a whole, in other saints of ancient times, and hence he is all the more suggestive a type of our Lord. David knew the trials of all ranks and conditions of men. Kings have their troubles, and David wore a crown: the peasant has his cares, and David handled a shepherd&rsquo;s crook: the wanderer has many hardships, and David abode in the caves of Engedi: the captain has his difficulties, and David found the sons of Zeruiah too hard for him. The psalmist was also tried in his friends, his counsellor Ahithophel forsook him, &ldquo;He that eateth bread with me, hath lifted up his heel against me.&rdquo; His worst foes were they of his own household: his children were his greatest affliction. The temptations of poverty and wealth, of honour and reproach, of health and weakness, all tried their power upon him. He had temptations from without to disturb his peace, and from within to mar his joy. David no sooner escaped from one trial than he fell into another; no sooner emerged from one season of despondency and alarm, than he was again brought into the lowest depths, and all God&rsquo;s waves and billows rolled over him. It is probably from this cause that David&rsquo;s psalms are so universally the delight of experienced Christians. Whatever our frame of mind, whether ecstasy or depression, David has exactly described our emotions. He was an able master of the human heart, because he had been tutored in the best of all schools—the school of heart-felt, personal experience. As we are instructed in the same school, as we grow matured in grace and in years, we increasingly appreciate David&rsquo;s psalms, and find them to be &ldquo;green pastures.&rdquo; My soul, let David&rsquo;s experience cheer and counsel thee this day.</p>

<div align="center"><a name="d0820pm-p2.1" id="d0820pm-p2.1"></a>

<h3 align="center" id="d0820pm-p2.2"><a id="d0820pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Nehemiah_3:8" onclick="return goBible('ot','Neh','3','8','3','8');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Neh 3:8 - 3:8')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Neh_3_8_0_0">Nehemiah 3:8</a></h3>
<p id="d0820pm-p3">Cities well fortified have broad walls, and so had Jerusalem in her glory. The New Jerusalem must, in like manner, be surrounded and preserved by a broad wall of nonconformity to the world, and <em>separation</em> from its customs and spirit. The tendency of these days break down the holy barrier, and make the distinction between the church and the world merely nominal. Professors are no longer strict and Puritanical, questionable literature is read on all hands, frivolous pastimes are currently indulged, and a general laxity threatens to deprive the Lord&rsquo;s peculiar people of those sacred singularities which separate them from sinners. It will be an ill day for the church and the world when the proposed amalgamation shall be complete, and the sons of God and the daughters of men shall be as one: then shall another deluge of wrath be ushered in. Beloved reader, be it your aim in heart, in word, in dress, in action to maintain the broad wall, remembering that the friendship of this world is enmity against God.</p>
<p id="d0820pm-p4">The broad wall afforded a pleasant place of <em>resort</em> for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, from which they could command prospects of the surrounding country. This reminds us of the Lord&rsquo;s exceeding broad commandments, in which we walk at liberty in communion with Jesus, overlooking the scenes of earth, and looking out towards the glories of heaven. Separated from the world, and denying ourselves all ungodliness and fleshly lusts, we are nevertheless not in prison, nor restricted within narrow bounds; nay, we walk at liberty, because we keep his precepts. Come, reader, this evening walk with God in his statutes. As friend met friend upon the city wall, so meet thou thy God in the way of holy prayer and meditation. The bulwarks of salvation thou hast a right to traverse, for thou art a freeman of the royal burgh, a citizen of the metropolis of the universe.</p>
