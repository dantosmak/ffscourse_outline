<p id="d0214am-p3">Jehoiachin was not sent away from the king&rsquo;s palace with a store to last him for months, but his provision was given him as a daily pension. Herein he well pictures the happy position of all the Lord&rsquo;s people. A daily portion is <em>all that a man </em><em>really wants</em>. We do not need tomorrow&rsquo;s supplies; that day has not yet dawned, and its wants are as yet unborn. The thirst which we may suffer in the month of June does not need to be quenched in February, for we do not feel it yet; if we have enough for each day as the days arrive we shall never know want. Sufficient for the day is <em>all that we can enjoy</em>. We cannot eat or drink or wear more than the day&rsquo;s supply of food and raiment; the surplus gives us the care of storing it, and the anxiety of watching against a thief. One staff aids a traveller, but a bundle of staves is a heavy burden. Enough is not only as good as a feast, but is all that the greatest glutton can truly enjoy. This is <em>all that we should expect</em>; a craving for more than this is ungrateful. When our Father does not give us more, we should be content with his daily allowance. Jehoiachin&rsquo;s case is ours, we have a sure portion, a portion <em>given us of the </em><em>king</em>, a <em>gracious</em> portion, and a <em>perpetual portion</em>. Here is surely ground for thankfulness.</p>
<p id="d0214am-p4">Beloved Christian reader, in matters of grace <em>you need a </em><em>daily supply</em>. You have no store of strength. Day by day must you seek help from above. It is a very sweet assurance that <em>a </em><em>daily portion is provided for you</em>. In the word, through the ministry, by meditation, in prayer, and waiting upon God you shall receive renewed strength. In Jesus all needful things are laid up for you. Then <em>enjoy your continual allowance</em>. Never go hungry while the daily bread of grace is on the table of mercy.</p>

<p id="d0214pm-p3">One of the most touching and teaching of the Saviour&rsquo;s miracles is before us tonight. The woman was very ignorant. She imagined that virtue came out of Christ by a law of necessity, without his knowledge or direct will. Moreover, she was a stranger to the generosity of Jesus&rsquo; character, or she would not have gone behind to steal the cure which he was so ready to bestow. Misery should always place itself right in the face of mercy. Had she known the love of Jesus&rsquo; heart, she would have said, &ldquo;I have but to put myself where he can see me—his omniscience will teach him my case, and his love at once will work my cure.&rdquo; We admire her faith, but we marvel at her ignorance. After she had obtained the cure, she rejoiced with trembling: glad was she that the divine virtue had wrought a marvel in her; but she feared lest Christ should retract the blessing, and put a negative upon the grant of his grace: little did she comprehend the fulness of his love! We have not so clear a view of him as we could wish; we know not the heights and depths of his love; but we know of a surety that he is too good to withdraw from a trembling soul the gift which it has been able to obtain. But here is the marvel of it: little as was her knowledge, her faith, because it was real faith, saved her, and saved her at once. There was no tedious delay—faith&rsquo;s miracle was instantaneous. If we have faith as a grain of mustard seed, salvation is our present and eternal possession. If in the list of the Lord&rsquo;s children we are written as the feeblest of the family, yet, being heirs through faith, no power, human or devilish, can eject us from salvation. If we dare not lean our heads upon his bosom with John, yet if we can venture in the press behind him, and touch the hem of his garment, we are made whole. Courage, timid one! thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. &ldquo;<em>Being</em> justified by faith, we <em>have</em> peace with God.&rdquo;</p>
