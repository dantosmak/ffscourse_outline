<p id="d0213am-p3">&ldquo;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us.&rdquo; Consider who we were, and what we feel ourselves to be even now when corruption is powerful in us, and you will wonder at our adoption. Yet we are called &ldquo;<em>the sons of God</em>.&rdquo; What a high relationship is that of a son, and what privileges it brings! What care and tenderness the son expects from his father, and what love the father feels towards the son! But all <em>that</em>, and more than that, we now have through Christ. As for the temporary drawback of suffering with the elder brother, this we accept as an honour: &ldquo;Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.&rdquo; We are content to be unknown with him in his humiliation, for we are to be exalted with him. &ldquo;<em>Beloved, now are we the sons of God</em>.&rdquo; That is easy to read, but it is not so easy to feel. How is it with your heart this morning? Are you in the lowest depths of sorrow? Does corruption rise within your spirit, and grace seem like a poor spark trampled under foot? Does your faith almost fail you? Fear not, it is neither your graces nor feelings on which you are to live: you must live simply by faith on Christ. With all these things against us, now—in the very depths of our sorrow, wherever we may be—<em>now</em>, as much in the valley as on the mountain, &ldquo;Beloved, <em>now</em> are we the sons of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, but,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;see how I am arrayed! my graces are not bright; my righteousness does not shine with apparent glory.&rdquo; But read the next: <em>&ldquo;It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know</em><em>that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him</em>.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit shall purify our minds, and divine power shall refine our bodies; then shall<em>we see him as he is</em>.</p>

<p id="d0213pm-p3">Come, my soul, think thou of this. Believing in Jesus, thou art actually and effectually cleared from guilt; thou art led out of thy prison. Thou art no more in fetters as a bond-slave; thou art delivered <em>now</em> from the bondage of the law; thou art freed from sin, and canst walk at large as a freeman; thy Saviour&rsquo;s blood has procured thy full discharge. Thou hast a right now to approach thy Father&rsquo;s throne. No flames of vengeance are there to scare thee now; no fiery sword; justice cannot smite the innocent. Thy disabilities are taken away: thou wast once unable to see thy Father&rsquo;s face: thou canst see it now. Thou couldst not speak with him: but now thou hast access with boldness. Once there was a fear of hell upon thee; but thou hast no fear of it now, for how can there be punishment for the guiltless? He who believeth is not condemned, and cannot be punished. And more than all, the privileges thou mightst have enjoyed, if thou hadst never sinned, are thine now that thou art justified. All the blessings which thou wouldst have had if thou hadst kept the law, and more, are thine, because Christ has kept it for thee. All the love and the acceptance which perfect obedience could have obtained of God, belong to thee, because Christ was perfectly obedient on thy behalf, and hath imputed all his merits to thy account, that thou mightst be exceeding rich through him, who for thy sake became exceeding poor. Oh! how great the debt of love and gratitude thou owest to thy Saviour!</p>
