<p id="d0322am-p3">There are several instructive features in our Saviour&rsquo;s prayer in his hour of trial. It was <em>lonely prayer</em>. He withdrew even from his three favoured disciples. Believer, be much in solitary prayer, especially in times of trial. Family prayer, social prayer, prayer in the Church, will not suffice, these are very precious, but the best beaten spice will smoke in your censer in your private devotions, where no ear hears but God's.</p>
<p id="d0322am-p4">It was <em>humble prayer</em>. Luke says he knelt, but another evangelist says he &ldquo;fell on his face.&rdquo; Where, then, must be <span id="d0322am-p4.1">thy</span> place, thou humble servant of the great Master? What dust and ashes should cover <em>thy</em> head! Humility gives us good foot-hold in prayer. There is no hope of prevalence with God unless we abase ourselves that he may exalt us in due time.</p>
<p id="d0322am-p5">It was <em>filial prayer</em>. &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; You will find it a stronghold in the day of trial to plead your adoption. You have no rights as a subject, you have forfeited them by your treason; but nothing can forfeit a child&rsquo;s right to a father&rsquo;s protection. Be not afraid to say, &ldquo;My Father, hear my cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="d0322am-p6">Observe that it was <em>persevering prayer</em>. He prayed three times. Cease not until you prevail. Be as the importunate widow, whose continual coming earned what her first supplication could not win. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving.</p>
<p id="d0322am-p7">Lastly, <em>it was the prayer of resignation</em>. &ldquo;Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.&rdquo; Yield, and God yields. Let it be as God wills, and God will determine for the best. Be thou content to leave thy prayer in his hands, who knows when to give, and how to give, and what to give, and what to withhold. So pleading, earnestly, importunately, yet with humility and resignation, thou shalt surely prevail.</p>

<p align="center" id="d0322pm-p1"><a id="d0322pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d0322am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d0322pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p id="d0322pm-p3">O death! why dost thou touch the tree beneath whose spreading branches weariness hath rest? Why dost thou snatch away the excellent of the earth, in whom is all our delight? If thou must use thine axe, use it upon the trees which yield no fruit; thou mightest be thanked then. But why wilt thou fell the goodly cedars of Lebanon? O stay thine axe, and spare the righteous. But no, it must not be; death smites the goodliest of our friends; the most generous, the most prayerful, the most holy, the most devoted must die. And why? It is through Jesus&rsquo; prevailing prayer—&ldquo;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.&rdquo; It is <em>that</em> which bears them on eagle&rsquo;s wings to heaven. Every time a believer mounts from this earth to paradise, it is an answer to Christ&rsquo;s prayer. A good old divine remarks, &ldquo;Many times Jesus and his people pull against one another in prayer. You bend your knee in prayer and say &lsquo;Father, I will that thy saints be with me where <em>I</em> am;&rsquo; Christ says, &lsquo;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where <em>I</em> am.&rsquo;&rdquo; Thus the disciple is at cross-purposes with his Lord. The soul cannot be in both places: the beloved one cannot be with Christ and with you too. Now, which pleader shall win the day? If you had your choice; if the King should step from his throne, and say, &ldquo;Here are two supplicants praying in opposition to one another, which shall be answered?&rdquo; Oh! I am sure, though it were agony, you would start from your feet, and say, &ldquo;Jesus, not my will, but thine be done.&rdquo; You would give up your prayer for your loved one&rsquo;s life, if you could realize the thoughts that Christ is praying in the opposite direction—&ldquo;Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am.&rdquo; Lord, thou shalt have them. By faith we let them go.</p>
