<p id="d1027am-p3">Paul has four of these &ldquo;<em>faithful sayings</em>.&rdquo; The first occurs in <a id="d1027am-p3.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/1_Timothy%201:15" onclick="return goBible('nt','iTim','1','15','1','15');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iTim 1:15 - 1:15')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_1Tim_1_15_0_0">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, &ldquo;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&rdquo; The next is in <a id="d1027am-p3.2" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/1_Timothy%204:6" onclick="return goBible('nt','iTim','4','6','4','6');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iTim 4:6 - 4:6')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_1Tim_4_6_0_0">1 Timothy 4:6</a>, &ldquo;Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.&rdquo; The third is in <a id="d1027am-p3.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/2_Timothy%202:12" onclick="return goBible('nt','iiTim','2','12','2','12');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'iiTim 2:12 - 2:12')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_2Tim_2_12_0_0">2 Timothy 2:12</a>, &ldquo;It is a faithful saying—If we suffer with him we shall also reign with him&rdquo;; and the fourth is in <a id="d1027am-p3.4" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Titus_3:3" onclick="return goBible('nt','Titus','3','3','3','3');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Titus 3:3 - 3:3')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Titus_3_3_0_0">Titus 3:3</a>, &ldquo;This is a faithful saying, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.&rdquo; We may trace a connection between these faithful sayings. The first one lays the foundation of our eternal salvation in the free grace of God, as shown to us in the mission of the great Redeemer. The next affirms the double blessedness which we obtain through this salvation—the blessings of the upper and nether springs—of time and of eternity. The third shows one of the duties to which the chosen people are called; we are ordained to suffer for Christ with the promise that &ldquo;if we suffer, we shall also reign with him.&rdquo; The last sets forth the active form of Christian service, bidding us diligently to maintain good works. Thus we have the root of salvation in free grace; next, the privileges of that salvation in the life which now is, and in that which is to come; and we have also the two great branches of suffering with Christ and serving with Christ, loaded with the fruits of the Spirit. Treasure up these faithful sayings. Let them be the guides of our life, our comfort, and our instruction. The apostle of the Gentiles proved them to be faithful, they are faithful still, not one word shall fall to the ground; they are worthy of all acceptation, let us accept them now, and prove their faithfulness. Let these four faithful sayings be written on the four corners of my house.</p>
<h2 align="center" id="d1027pm-p0.1">Evening, October 27</h2>
<p align="center" id="d1027pm-p1"><a id="d1027pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1027am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1027pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;We are all as an unclean thing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1027pm-p2.1" id="d1027pm-p2.1"></a>
</div>
<h3 align="center" id="d1027pm-p2.2"><a id="d1027pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Isaiah_64:6" onclick="return goBible('ot','Isa','64','6','64','6');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Isa 64:6 - 64:6')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Isa_64_6_0_0">Isaiah 64:6</a></h3>
<p id="d1027pm-p3">The believer is a new creature, he belongs to a holy generation and a peculiar people—the Spirit of God is in him, and in all respects he is far removed from the natural man; but for all that the Christian is a sinner still. He is so from the imperfection of his nature, and will continue so to the end of his earthly life. The black fingers of sin leave smuts upon our fairest robes. Sin mars our repentance, ere the great Potter has finished it, upon the wheel. Selfishness defiles our tears, and unbelief tampers with our faith. The best thing we ever did apart from the merit of Jesus only swelled the number of our sins; for when we have been most pure in our own sight, yet, like the heavens, we are not pure in God&rsquo;s sight; and as he charged his angels with folly, much more must he charge us with it, even in our most angelic frames of mind. The song which thrills to heaven, and seeks to emulate seraphic strains, hath human discords in it. The prayer which moves the arm of God is still a bruised and battered prayer, and only moves that arm because the sinless One, the great Mediator, has stepped in to take away the sin of our supplication. The most golden faith or the purest degree of sanctification to which a Christian ever attained on earth, has still so much alloy in it as to be only worthy of the flames, in itself considered. Every night we look in the glass we see a sinner, and had need confess, &ldquo;We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.&rdquo; Oh, how precious the blood of Christ to such hearts as ours! How priceless a gift is his perfect righteousness! And how bright the hope of perfect holiness hereafter! Even now, though sin dwells in us, <em>its power is broken</em>. It has no dominion; it is a broken-backed snake; we are in bitter conflict with it, but it is with a vanquished foe that we have to deal. Yet a little while and we shall enter victoriously into the city where nothing defileth.</p>
