<p align="center" id="d1114am-p1"><a id="d1114am-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1114pm.html">Go To Evening Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1114am-p2"><em>&ldquo;I will cut off them that worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1114am-p2.1" id="d1114am-p2.1"></a>

<h3 align="center" id="d1114am-p2.2"><a id="d1114am-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Zephaniah_1:5" onclick="return goBible('ot','Zeph','1','5','1','5');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Zeph 1:5 - 1:5')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Zeph_1_5_0_0">Zephaniah 1:5</a></h3>
<p id="d1114am-p3">Such persons thought themselves safe because they were with both parties: they went with the followers of Jehovah, and bowed at the same time to Malcham. But duplicity is abominable with God, and hypocrisy his soul hateth. The idolater who distinctly gives himself to his false god, has one sin less than he who brings his polluted and detestable sacrifice unto the temple of the Lord, while his heart is with the world and the sins thereof. To hold with the hare and run with the hounds, is a dastard&rsquo;s policy. In the common matters of daily life, a double- minded man is despised, but in religion he is loathsome to the last degree. The penalty pronounced in the verse before us is terrible, but it is well deserved; for how should divine justice spare the sinner, who knows the right, approves it, and professes to follow it, and all the while loves the evil, and gives it dominion in his heart?</p>
<p id="d1114am-p4">My soul, search thyself this morning, and see whether thou art guilty of double-dealing. Thou professest to be a follower of Jesus—dost thou truly love him? Is thy heart right with God? Art thou of the family of old Father Honest, or art thou a relative of Mr. By-ends? A name to live is of little value if I be indeed dead in trespasses and sins. To have one foot on the land of truth, and another on the sea of falsehood, will involve a terrible fall and a total ruin. Christ will be all or nothing. God fills the whole universe, and hence there is no room for another god; if, then, he reigns in my heart, there will be no space for another reigning power. Do I rest alone on Jesus crucified, and live alone for him? Is it my desire to do so? Is my heart set upon so doing? If so, blessed be the mighty grace which has led me to salvation; and if not so, O Lord, pardon my sad offence, and unite my heart to fear thy name.</p>
<h2 align="center" id="d1114pm-p0.1">Evening, November 14</h2>
<p align="center" id="d1114pm-p1"><a id="d1114pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1114am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1114pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1114pm-p2.1" id="d1114pm-p2.1"></a>
</div>
<h3 align="center" id="d1114pm-p2.2"><a id="d1114pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Genesis_29:26" onclick="return goBible('ot','Gen','29','26','29','26');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Gen 29:26 - 29:26')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Gen_29_26_0_0">Genesis 29:26</a></h3>
<p id="d1114pm-p3">We do not excuse Laban for his dishonesty, but we scruple not to learn from the custom which he quoted as his excuse. There are some things which must be taken in order, and if we would win the second we must secure the first. The second may be the more lovely in our eyes, but the rule of the heavenly country must stand, and the elder must be married first. For instance, many men desire the beautiful and well-favoured Rachel of joy and peace in believing, but they must first be wedded to the tender-eyed Leah of repentance. Every one falls in love with happiness, and many would cheerfully serve twice seven years to enjoy it, but according to the rule of the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom, the Leah of real holiness must be beloved of our soul before the Rachel of true happiness can be attained. Heaven stands not first but second, and only by persevering to the end can we win a portion in it. The cross must be carried before the crown can be worn. We must follow our Lord in his humiliation, or we shall never rest with him in glory.</p>
<p id="d1114pm-p4">My soul, what sayest thou, art thou so vain as to hope to break through the heavenly rule? Dost thou hope for reward without labour, or honour without toil? Dismiss the idle expectation, and be content to take the ill-favoured things for the sake of the sweet love of Jesus, which will recompense thee for all. In such a spirit, labouring and suffering, thou wilt find bitters grow sweet, and hard things easy. Like Jacob, thy years of service will seem unto thee but a few days for the love thou hast to Jesus; and when the dear hour of the wedding feast shall come, all thy toils shall be as though they had never been—an hour with Jesus will make up for ages of pain and labour.</p>
