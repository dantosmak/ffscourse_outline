<p id="d1008am-p3">We learn from this narrative, <em>the necessity of human </em><em>agency</em>. The draught of fishes was miraculous, yet neither the fisherman nor his boat, nor his fishing tackle were ignored; but all were used to take the fishes. So in the saving of souls, God worketh by means; and while the present economy of grace shall stand, God will be pleased by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. When God worketh without instruments, doubtless he is glorified; but he hath himself selected the plan of instrumentality as being that by which he is most magnified in the earth. <em>Means of themselves are utterly unavailing</em>. &ldquo;Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing.&rdquo; What was the reason of this? Were they not fishermen plying their special calling? Verily, they were no raw hands; they understood the work. Had they gone about the toil unskilfully? No. Had they lacked industry? No, they had toiled. Had they lacked perseverance? No, they had <em>toiled all the night</em>. Was there a deficiency of fish in the sea? Certainly not, for as soon as the Master came, they swam to the net in shoals. What, then, is the reason? Is it because there is no power in the means of themselves apart from the presence of Jesus? &ldquo;Without him we can do nothing.&rdquo; But with Christ we can do all things. <em>Christ&rsquo;s presence confers success</em>. Jesus sat in Peter&rsquo;s boat, and his will, by a mysterious influence, drew the fish to the net. When Jesus is lifted up in his Church, his presence is the Church&rsquo;s power—the shout of a king is in the midst of her. &ldquo;I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.&rdquo; Let us go out this morning on our work of soul fishing, looking up in faith, and around us in solemn anxiety. Let us toil till night comes, and we shall not labour in vain, for he who bids us let down the net, will fill it with fishes.</p>

<p align="center" id="d1008pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;Praying in the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1008pm-p2.1" id="d1008pm-p2.1"></a>
</div>
<h3 align="center" id="d1008pm-p2.2"><a id="d1008pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Jude_1:20" onclick="return goBible('nt','Jude','1','20','1','20');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Jude 1:20 - 1:20')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Jude_1_20_0_0">Jude 20</a></h3>
<p id="d1008pm-p3">Mark the grand characteristic of true prayer—&ldquo;<em>In the Holy </em><em>Ghost</em>.&rdquo; The seed of acceptable devotion must come from heaven&rsquo;s storehouse. Only the prayer which comes from God can go to God. We must shoot the Lord&rsquo;s arrows back to him. That desire which he writes upon our heart will move his heart and bring down a blessing, but the desires of the flesh have no power with him.</p>
<p id="d1008pm-p4">Praying in the Holy Ghost is praying in <em>fervency</em>. Cold prayers ask the Lord not to hear them. Those who do not plead with fervency, plead not at all. As well speak of lukewarm fire as of lukewarm prayer—it is essential that it be red hot. It is praying <em>perseveringly</em>. The true suppliant gathers force as he proceeds, and grows more fervent when God delays to answer. The longer the gate is closed, the more vehemently does he use the knocker, and the longer the angel lingers the more resolved is he that he will never let him go without the blessing. Beautiful in God&rsquo;s sight is tearful, agonizing, unconquerable importunity. It means praying <em>humbly</em>, for the Holy Spirit never puffs us up with pride. It is his office to convince of sin, and so to bow us down in contrition and brokenness of spirit. We shall never sing <em>Gloria in excelsis</em> except we pray to God <em>De profundis</em>: out of the depths must we cry, or we shall never behold glory in the highest. It is <em>loving</em>prayer. Prayer should be perfumed with love, saturated with love—love to our fellow saints, and love to Christ. Moreover, it must be a prayer full of <em>faith</em>. A man prevails only as he believes. The Holy Spirit is the author of faith, and strengthens it, so that we pray believing God&rsquo;s promise. O that this blessed combination of excellent graces, priceless and sweet as the spices of the merchant, might be fragrant within us because the Holy Ghost is in our hearts! Most blessed Comforter, exert thy mighty power within us, helping our infirmities in prayer.</p>
