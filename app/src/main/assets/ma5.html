<p id="d0505am-p3">What a sweet title: &ldquo;My people!&rdquo; What a cheering revelation: &ldquo;Their God!&rdquo; How much of meaning is couched in those two words, &ldquo;My people!&rdquo; Here is <em>speciality</em>. The whole world is God's; the heaven, even the heaven of heavens is the Lord's, and he reigneth among the children of men; but of those whom he hath chosen, whom he hath purchased to himself, he saith what he saith not of others—&ldquo;My people.&rdquo; In this word there is the idea of <em>proprietorship</em>. In a special manner the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.&rdquo; All the nations upon earth are his; the whole world is in his power; yet are his people, his chosen, more especially his possession; for he has done more for them than others; he has bought them with his blood; he has brought them nigh to himself; he has set his great heart upon them; he has loved them with an everlasting love, a love which many waters cannot quench, and which the revolutions of time shall never suffice in the least degree to diminish. Dear friends, can you, by faith, see yourselves in that number? Can you look up to heaven and say, &ldquo;My Lord and my God: mine by that sweet <em>relationship</em> which entitles me to call thee Father; mine by that hallowed <em>fellowship</em> which I delight to hold with thee when thou art pleased to manifest thyself unto me as thou dost not unto the world?&rdquo; Canst thou read the Book of Inspiration, and find there the indentures of thy salvation? Canst thou read thy title writ in precious blood? Canst thou, by humble faith, lay hold of Jesus&rsquo; garments, and say, &ldquo;My Christ&rdquo;? If thou canst, then God saith of thee, and of others like thee, &ldquo;My people;&rdquo; for, if God be your God, and Christ your Christ, the Lord has a special, peculiar favour to you; you are the object of his choice, accepted in his beloved Son.</p>

<p id="d0505pm-p3">Wisdom is man&rsquo;s true strength; and, under its guidance, he best accomplishes the ends of his being. Wisely handling the matter of life gives to man the richest enjoyment, and presents the noblest occupation for his powers; hence by it he finds good in the fullest sense. Without wisdom, man is as the wild ass&rsquo;s colt, running hither and thither, wasting strength which might be profitably employed. Wisdom is the compass by which man is to steer across the trackless waste of life; without it he is a derelict vessel, the sport of winds and waves. A man must be prudent in such a world as this, or he will find no good, but be betrayed into unnumbered ills. The pilgrim will sorely wound his feet among the briers of the wood of life if he does not pick his steps with the utmost caution. He who is in a wilderness infested with robber bands must handle matters wisely if he would journey safely. If, trained by the Great Teacher, we follow where he leads, we shall find good, even while in this dark abode; there are celestial fruits to be gathered this side of Eden&rsquo;s bowers, and songs of paradise to be sung amid the groves of earth. But where shall this wisdom be found? Many have dreamed of it, but have not possessed it. Where shall we learn it? Let us listen to the voice of the Lord, for he hath declared the secret; he hath revealed to the sons of men wherein true wisdom lieth, and we have it in the text, &ldquo;Whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.&rdquo; <em>The true way to handle a matter wisely is </em><em>to trust in the Lord</em>. This is the sure clue to the most intricate labyrinths of life; follow it and find eternal bliss. He who trusts in the Lord has a diploma for wisdom granted by inspiration: happy is he now, and happier shall he be above. Lord, in this sweet eventide walk with me in the garden, and teach me the wisdom of faith.</p>
