<p id="d0228am-p3">It is the believer&rsquo;s privilege to use this language. If he is looking for aught from the world, it is a poor &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; indeed. But if he looks to God for the supply of his wants, whether in temporal or spiritual blessings, his &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; will not be a vain one. Constantly he may draw from the bank of faith, and get his need supplied out of the riches of God&rsquo;s lovingkindness. This I know, I had rather have God for my banker than all the Rothschilds. My Lord never fails to honour his promises; and when we bring them to his throne, he never sends them back unanswered. Therefore I will wait only at his door, for he ever opens it with the hand of munificent grace. At this hour I will try him anew. But we have &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; beyond this life. We shall die soon; and then our &ldquo;expectation is from him.&rdquo; Do we not expect that when we lie upon the bed of sickness he will send angels to carry us to his bosom? We believe that when the pulse is faint, and the heart heaves heavily, some angelic messenger shall stand and look with loving eyes upon us, and whisper, &ldquo;Sister spirit, come away!&rdquo; As we approach the heavenly gate, we expect to hear the welcome invitation, &ldquo;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&rdquo; We are expecting harps of gold and crowns of glory; we are hoping soon to be amongst the multitude of shining ones before the throne; we are looking forward and longing for the time when we shall be like our glorious Lord—for &ldquo;We shall see him as he is.&rdquo; Then if these be thine &ldquo;expectations,&rdquo; O my soul, live for God; live with the desire and resolve to glorify him from whom cometh all thy supplies, and of whose grace in thy election, redemption, and calling, it is that thou hast any &ldquo;expectation&rdquo; of coming glory.</p>

<p id="d0228pm-p3">See the faithfulness of divine love. You observe that this woman had daily necessities. She had herself and her son to feed in a time of famine; and now, in addition, the prophet Elijah was to be fed too. But though the need was threefold, yet the supply of meal wasted not, for she had a <em>constant supply</em>. Each day she made calls upon the barrel, but yet each day it remained the same. You, dear reader, have daily necessities, and because they come so frequently, you are apt to fear that the barrel of meal will one day be empty, and the cruse of oil will fail you. Rest assured that, according to the Word of God, this shall not be the case. Each day, though it bring its trouble, shall bring its help; and though you should live to outnumber the years of Methuselah, and though your needs should be as many as the sands of the seashore, yet shall God&rsquo;s grace and mercy last through all your necessities, and you shall never know a real lack. For three long years, in this widow&rsquo;s days, the heavens never saw a cloud, and the stars never wept a holy tear of dew upon the wicked earth: famine, and desolation, and death, made the land a howling wilderness, but this woman never was hungry, but always joyful in abundance. So shall it be with you. You shall see the sinner&rsquo;s hope perish, for he trusts his native strength; you shall see the proud Pharisee&rsquo;s confidence totter, for he builds his hope upon the sand; you shall see even your own schemes blasted and withered, but you yourself shall find that your place of defence shall be the munition of rocks: &ldquo;Your bread shall be given you, and your water shall be sure.&rdquo; Better have God for your guardian, than the Bank of England for your possession. You might spend the wealth of the Indies, but the infinite riches of God you can never exhaust.</p>
