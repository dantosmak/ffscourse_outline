<p id="d0419am-p3">No mean miracle was wrought in the rending of so strong and thick a veil; but it was not intended merely as a display of power—many lessons were herein taught us. <em>The old law of </em><em>ordinances was put away</em>, and like a worn-out vesture, rent and laid aside. When Jesus died, the sacrifices were all finished, because all fulfilled in him, and therefore the place of their presentation was marked with an evident token of decay. That rent also <em>revealed all the hidden things of the old </em><em>dispensation</em>: the mercy-seat could now be seen, and the glory of God gleamed forth above it. By the death of our Lord Jesus we have a clear revelation of God, for he was &ldquo;not as Moses, who put a veil over his face.&rdquo; Life and immortality are now brought to light, and things which have been hidden since the foundation of the world are manifest in him. <em>The annual </em><em>ceremony of atonement was thus abolished. The atoning blood</em> which was once every year sprinkled within the veil, was now offered once for all by the great High Priest, and therefore the place of the symbolical rite was broken up. No blood of bullocks or of lambs is needed now, for Jesus has entered within the veil with his own blood. Hence <em>access to God is now permitted</em>, and is the privilege of every believer in Christ Jesus. There is no small space laid open through which we may peer at the mercy-seat, but the rent reaches from the top to the bottom. We may come with boldness to the throne of the heavenly grace. Shall we err if we say that the opening of the Holy of Holies in this marvellous manner by our Lord&rsquo;s expiring cry was <em>the type </em><em>of the opening of the gates of paradise</em> to all the saints by virtue of the Passion? Our bleeding Lord hath the key of heaven; he openeth and no man shutteth; let us enter in with him into the heavenly places, and sit with him there till our common enemies shall be made his footstool.</p>

<p id="d0419pm-p3">The word <span id="d0419pm-p3.1">Amen</span> solemnly confirms that which went before; and Jesus is the great Confirmer; immutable, forever is &ldquo;the Amen&rdquo; in all <em>his promises. Sinner</em>, I would comfort thee with this reflection. Jesus Christ said, &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; If you come to him, he will say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; in your soul; his promise shall be true <em>to you</em>. He said in the days of his flesh, &ldquo;The bruised reed I will not break.&rdquo; O thou poor, broken, bruised heart, if thou comest to him, he will say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to thee, and that shall be true in<em>thy</em> soul as in hundreds of cases in bygone years. <em>Christian</em>, is not this very comforting to thee also, that there is not a word which has gone out of the Saviour&rsquo;s lips which he has ever retracted? The words of Jesus shall stand when heaven and earth shall pass away. If thou gettest a hold of but half a promise, thou shalt find it true. Beware of him who is called &ldquo;Clip-promise,&rdquo; who will destroy much of the comfort of God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p id="d0419pm-p4">Jesus is Yea and Amen in all <em>his offices</em>. He was a Priest to pardon and cleanse once, he is Amen as Priest still. He was a King to rule and reign for his people, and to defend them with his mighty arm, he is an Amen King, the same still. He was a Prophet of old, to foretell good things to come, his lips are most sweet, and drop with honey still—he is an Amen Prophet. He is Amen as to the merit of his blood; he is Amen as to his righteousness. That sacred robe shall remain most fair and glorious when nature shall decay. He is Amen in every single title which he bears; your Husband, never seeking a divorce; your Friend, sticking closer than a brother; your Shepherd, with you in death&rsquo;s dark vale; your Help and your Deliverer; your Castle and your High Tower; the Horn of your strength, your confidence, your joy, your all in all, and your Yea and Amen in all.</p>
