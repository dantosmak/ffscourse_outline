<p id="d1104am-p3">A primary qualification for serving God with any amount of success, and for doing God&rsquo;s work well and triumphantly, is a sense of our own weakness. When God&rsquo;s warrior marches forth to battle, strong in his own might, when he boasts, &ldquo;I know that I shall conquer, my own right arm and my conquering sword shall get unto me the victory,&rdquo; defeat is not far distant. God will not go forth with that man who marches in his own strength. He who reckoneth on victory thus has reckoned wrongly, for &ldquo;it is not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.&rdquo; They who go forth to fight, boasting of their prowess, shall return with their gay banners trailed in the dust, and their armour stained with disgrace. Those who serve God must serve him in his own way, and in his strength, or he will never accept their service. That which man doth, unaided by divine strength, God can never own. The mere fruits of the earth he casteth away; he will only reap that corn, the seed of which was sown from heaven, watered by grace, and ripened by the sun of divine love. God will empty out all that thou hast before he will put his own into thee; he will first clean out thy granaries before he will fill them with the finest of the wheat. The river of God is full of water; but not one drop of it flows from earthly springs. God will have no strength used in his battles but the strength which he himself imparts. Are you mourning over your own weakness? Take courage, for there must be a consciousness of weakness before the Lord will give thee victory. Your emptiness is but the preparation for your being filled, and your casting down is but the making ready for your lifting up.</p>

<p id="d1104pm-p3">No lips can tell the love of Christ to the heart till Jesus himself shall speak within. Descriptions all fall flat and tame unless the Holy Ghost fills them with life and power; till our Immanuel reveals himself within, the soul sees him not. If you would see the sun, would you gather together the common means of illumination, and seek in that way to behold the orb of day? No, the wise man knoweth that the sun must reveal itself, and only by its own blaze can that mighty lamp be seen. It is so with Christ. &ldquo;Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona:&rdquo; said he to Peter, &ldquo;for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee.&rdquo; Purify flesh and blood by any educational process you may select, elevate mental faculties to the highest degree of intellectual power, yet none of these can reveal Christ. The Spirit of God must come with power, and overshadow the man with his wings, and then in that mystic holy of holies the Lord Jesus must display himself to the sanctified eye, as he doth not unto the purblind sons of men. Christ must be his own mirror. The great mass of this blear-eyed world can see nothing of the ineffable glories of Immanuel. He stands before them without form or comeliness, a root out of a dry ground, rejected by the vain and despised by the proud. Only where the Spirit has touched the eye with eye-salve, quickened the heart with divine life, and educated the soul to a heavenly taste, only there is he understood. &ldquo;To you that believe he is precious;&rdquo; to you he is the chief corner-stone, the Rock of your salvation, your all in all; but to others he is &ldquo;a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.&rdquo; Happy are those to whom our Lord manifests himself, for his promise to such is that he willÂ <em>make his abode with them</em>. O Jesus, our Lord, our heart is open, come in, and go out no more forever. Show thyself to us now! Favour us with a glimpse of thine all-conquering charms.</p>
