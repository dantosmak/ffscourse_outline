<p id="d0524am-p3">In looking back upon the character of our prayers, if we do it honestly, we shall be filled with wonder that God has ever answered them. There may be some who think their prayers worthy of acceptance—as the Pharisee did; but the true Christian, in a more enlightened retrospect, weeps over his prayers, and if he could retrace his steps he would desire to pray more earnestly. Remember, Christian, how<em>cold</em> thy prayers have been. When in thy closet thou shouldst have wrestled as Jacob did; but instead thereof, thy petitions have been faint and few—far removed from that humble, believing, persevering faith, which cries, &ldquo;I will not let thee go except thou bless me.&rdquo; Yet, wonderful to say, God has heard these cold prayers of thine, and not only heard, but answered them. Reflect also, how <em>infrequent</em> have been thy prayers, unless thou hast been in trouble, and <em>then</em> thou hast gone often to the mercy-seat: but when deliverance has come, where has been thy constant supplication? Yet, notwithstanding thou hast ceased to pray as once thou didst, God has not ceased to bless. When thou hast neglected the mercy-seat, God has not deserted it, but the bright light of the Shekinah has always been visible between the wings of the cherubim. Oh! it is marvellous that the Lord should regard those intermittent spasms of importunity which come and go with our necessities. What a God is he thus to hear the prayers of those who come to him when they have pressing wants, but neglect him when they have received a mercy; who approach him when they are forced to come, but who almost forget to address him when mercies are plentiful and sorrows are few. Let his gracious kindness in hearing such prayers touch our hearts, so that we may henceforth be found &ldquo;Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0524pm-p3">The word &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; does not merely mean our talk and converse with one another, but the whole course of our life and behaviour in the world. The Greek word signifies the actions and the privileges of citizenship: and thus we are commanded to let our actions, as citizens of the New Jerusalem, be such as becometh the gospel of Christ. What sort of conversation is this? In the first place, <em>the gospel is very simple</em>. So Christians should be simple and plain in their habits. There should be about our manner, our speech, our dress, our whole behaviour, that simplicity which is the very soul of beauty. The gospel is <em>pre-eminently true</em>, it is gold without dross; and the Christian&rsquo;s life will be lustreless and valueless without the jewel of truth. The gospel is a very <em>fearless gospel</em>, it boldly proclaims the truth, whether men like it or not: we must be equally faithful and unflinching. But the gospel is also <em>very gentle</em>. Mark this spirit in its Founder: &ldquo;a bruised reed he will not break.&rdquo; Some professors are sharper than a thorn-hedge; such men are not like Jesus. Let us seek to win others by the gentleness of our words and acts. The gospel is <em>very loving</em>. It is the message of the God of love to a lost and fallen race. Christ&rsquo;s last command to his disciples was, &ldquo;Love one another.&rdquo; O for more real, hearty union and love to all the saints; for more tender compassion towards the souls of the worst and vilest of men! We must not forget that the gospel of Christ is <em>holy</em>. It never excuses sin: it pardons it, but only through an atonement. If our life is to resemble the gospel, we must shun, not merely the grosser vices, but everything that would hinder our perfect conformity to Christ. For his sake, for our own sakes, and for the sakes of others, we must strive day by day to let our conversation be more in accordance with his gospel.</p>
