<p id="d0812am-p3">Causes for disquietude there are none so long as this blessed sentence is true. <em>On earth</em> the Lord&rsquo;s power as readily controls the rage of the wicked as the rage of the sea; his love as easily refreshes the poor with mercy as the earth with showers. Majesty gleams in flashes of fire amid the tempest&rsquo;s horrors, and the glory of the Lord is seen in its grandeur in the fall of empires, and the crash of thrones. In all our conflicts and tribulations, we may behold the hand of the divine King.</p>

<p id="d0812am-p4"><em>In hell</em>, evil spirits own, with misery, his undoubted supremacy. When permitted to roam abroad, it is with a chain at their heel; the bit is in the mouth of behemoth, and the hook in the jaws of leviathan. Death&rsquo;s darts are under the Lord&rsquo;s lock, and the grave&rsquo;s prisons have divine power as their warder. The terrible vengeance of the Judge of all the earth makes fiends cower down and tremble, even as dogs in the kennel fear the hunter&rsquo;s whip.</p>

<p id="d0812pm-p3">The rainbow, the symbol of the covenant with Noah, is typical of our Lord Jesus, who is the Lord&rsquo;s witness to the people. When may we<em>expect to see the token of the covenant</em>? The rainbow is only to be seen painted upon a <em>cloud</em>. When the sinner&rsquo;s conscience is dark with clouds, when he remembers his past sin, and mourneth and lamenteth before God, Jesus Christ is revealed to him as the covenant Rainbow, displaying all the glorious hues of the divine character and betokening peace. To the believer, when his trials and temptations surround him, it is sweet to behold the person of our Lord Jesus Christ—to see him bleeding, living, rising, and pleading for us. God&rsquo;s rainbow is hung over the cloud of our sins, our sorrows, and our woes, to prophesy deliverance. Nor does a <em>cloud</em> alone give a rainbow, there must be <em>the crystal drops</em> to reflect the light of the sun. So, our sorrows must not only threaten, but they must really fall upon us. There had been no Christ for us if the vengeance of God had been merely a threatening cloud: punishment must fall in terrible drops upon the Surety. Until there is a <em>real</em> anguish in the sinner&rsquo;s conscience, there is no Christ for him; until the chastisement which he feels becomes grievous, he cannot see Jesus. But there must also be a sun; for clouds and drops of rain make not rainbows unless the sun shineth. Beloved, our God, who is as the sun to us, always shines, but we do not always see him—clouds hide his face; but no matter what drops may be falling, or what clouds may be threatening, if <em>he</em> does but shine there will be a rainbow at once. It is said that when we see the rainbow the shower is over. Certain it is, that when Christ comes, our troubles remove; when we behold Jesus, our sins vanish, and our doubts and fears subside. When Jesus walks the waters of the sea, how profound the calm!</p>
