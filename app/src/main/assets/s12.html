<p id="d0912am-p3"><em>Your Lord is very jealous of your love</em>, O believer. Did he choose you? He cannot bear that you should choose another. Did he buy you with his own blood? He cannot endure that you should think that you are your own, or that you belong to this world. He loved you with such a love that he would not stop in heaven without you; he would sooner die than you should perish, and he cannot endure that anything should stand between your heart&rsquo;s love and himself. <em>He is very jealous of your trust</em>. He will not permit you to trust in an arm of flesh. He cannot bear that you should hew out broken cisterns, when the overflowing fountain is always free to you. When we lean upon him, he is glad, but when we transfer our dependence to another, when we rely upon our own wisdom, or the wisdom of a friend—worst of all, when we trust in any works of our own, he is displeased, and will chasten us that he may bring us to himself. <em>He is also very jealous of our company</em>. There should be no one with whom we converse so much as with Jesus. To abide in him only, this is true love; but to commune with the world, to find sufficient solace in our carnal comforts, to prefer even the society of our fellow Christians to secret intercourse with him, this is grievous to our jealous Lord. He would fain have us abide in him, and enjoy constant fellowship with himself; and many of the trials which he sends us are for the purpose of weaning our hearts from the creature, and fixing them more closely upon himself. Let this jealousy which would keep us near to Christ <em>be also a comfort</em> to us, for if he loves us so much as to care thus about <em>our</em> love we may be sure that he will suffer nothing to harm us, and will protect us from all our enemies. Oh that we may have grace this day to keep our hearts in sacred chastity for our Beloved alone, with sacred jealousy shutting our eyes to all the fascinations of the world!</p>

<p id="d0912pm-p3">Faith triumphs in trial. When reason is thrust into the inner prison, with her feet made fast in the stocks, faith makes the dungeon walls ring with her merry notes as she cries, &ldquo;I will sing of mercy and of judgment. Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing.&rdquo; Faith pulls the black mask from the face of trouble, and discovers the angel beneath. Faith looks up at the cloud, and sees that</p>
<table id="d0912pm-p3.1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p id="d0912pm-p3.2">&ldquo;'Tis big with mercy and shall break</p>
        <p id="d0912pm-p3.3">In blessings on her head.&rdquo;</p></td>
    </tr>

<p id="d0912pm-p4">There is a subject for song even in the judgments of God towards us. For, first, the trial is <em>not so heavy as it might have </em><em>been</em>; next, the trouble is <em>not so severe as we deserved to </em><em>have borne</em>; and our affliction is <em>not so crushing as the </em><em>burden which others have to carry</em>. Faith sees that in her worst sorrow there is nothing penal; there is not a drop of God&rsquo;s wrath in it; it is all sent in love. Faith discerns love gleaming like a jewel on the breast of an angry God. Faith says of her grief, &ldquo;This is a badge of honour, for the child must feel the rod;&rdquo; and then she sings of the sweet result of her sorrows, because they work her spiritual good. Nay, more, says Faith, &ldquo;These light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for me a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.&rdquo; So Faith rides forth on the black horse, conquering and to conquer, trampling down carnal reason and fleshly sense, and chanting notes of victory amid the thickest of the fray.</p>
