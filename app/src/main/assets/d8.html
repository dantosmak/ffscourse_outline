<h2 align="center" id="d1208am-p0.1">Morning, December 8</h2>
<p align="center" id="d1208am-p1"><a id="d1208am-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1208pm.html">Go To Evening Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1208am-p2"><em>&ldquo;Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1208am-p2.1" id="d1208am-p2.1"></a>
</div>
<h3 align="center" id="d1208am-p2.2"><a id="d1208am-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Revelation_3:4" onclick="return goBible('nt','Rev','3','4','3','4');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Rev 3:4 - 3:4')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Rev_3_4_0_0">Revelation 3:4</a></h3>
<p id="d1208am-p3">We may understand this to refer to <em>justification</em>. &ldquo;They shall walk in white;&rdquo; that is, they shall enjoy a constant sense of their own justification by faith; they shall understand that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to them, that they have all been washed and made whiter than the newly-fallen snow.</p>
<p id="d1208am-p4">Again, it refers to <em>joy and gladness</em>: for white robes were holiday dresses among the Jews. They who have not defiled their garments shall have their faces always bright; they shall understand what Solomon meant when he said &ldquo;Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart. Let thy garments be always white, for God hath accepted thy works.&rdquo; He who is accepted of God shall wear white garments of joy and gladness, while he walks in sweet communion with the Lord Jesus. Whence so many doubts, so much misery, and mourning? It is because so many believers defile their garments with sin and error, and hence they lose the joy of their salvation, and the comfortable fellowship of the Lord Jesus, they do not here below walk in white.</p>
<p id="d1208am-p5">The promise also refers to <em>walking in white before the </em><em>throne of God</em>. Those who have not defiled their garments here shall most certainly walk in white up yonder, where the white-robed hosts sing perpetual hallelujahs to the Most High. They shall possess joys inconceivable, happiness beyond a dream, bliss which imagination knoweth not, blessedness which even the stretch of desire hath not reached. The &ldquo;undefiled in the way&rdquo; shall have all this—not of merit, nor of works, but of grace. They shall walk with Christ in white, for he has made them &ldquo;worthy.&rdquo; In his sweet company they shall drink of the living fountains of waters.</p>
<h2 align="center" id="d1208pm-p0.1">Evening, December 8</h2>
<p align="center" id="d1208pm-p1"><a id="d1208pm-p1.1" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/spurgeon/morneve.d1208am.html">Go To Morning Reading</a></p>
<p align="center" id="d1208pm-p2"><em>&ldquo;Thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.&rdquo;</em></p>
<div align="center"><a name="d1208pm-p2.1" id="d1208pm-p2.1"></a>

<h3 align="center" id="d1208pm-p2.2"><a id="d1208pm-p2.3" href="http://www.ccel.org/study/Psalms_68:10" onclick="return goBible('ot','Ps','68','10','68','10');" onmouseover="popupVerse(this, 'Ps 68:10 - 68:10')" onmouseout="leaveVerse()" name="_Ps_68_10_0_0">Psalm 68:10</a></h3>
<p id="d1208pm-p3">All God&rsquo;s gifts are prepared gifts laid up in store for wants foreseen. He anticipates our needs; and out of the fulness which he has treasured up in Christ Jesus, he provides of his goodness for the poor. You may trust him for all the necessities that can occur, for he has infallibly foreknown every one of them. He can say of us in all conditions, &ldquo;I knew that thou wouldst be this and that.&rdquo; A man goes a journey across the desert, and when he has made a day&rsquo;s advance, and pitched his tent, he discovers that he wants many comforts and necessaries which he has not brought in his baggage. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I did not foresee this: if I had this journey to go again, I should bring these things with me, so necessary to my comfort.&rdquo; But God has marked with prescient eye all the requirements of his poor wandering children, and when those needs occur, supplies are ready. It is goodness which he has prepared for the poor in heart, goodness and goodness only. &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;As thy days, so shall thy strength be.&rdquo;</p>
<p id="d1208pm-p4">Reader, is your heart heavy this evening? God knew it would be; the comfort which your heart wants is treasured in the sweet assurance of the text. You are poor and needy, but he has thought upon you, and has the exact blessing which you require in store for you. Plead the promise, believe it and obtain its fulfilment. Do you feel that you never were so consciously vile as you are now? Behold, the crimson fountain is open still, with all its former efficacy, to wash your sin away. Never shall you come into such a position that Christ cannot aid you. No pinch shall ever arrive in your spiritual affairs in which Jesus Christ shall not be equal to the emergency, for your history has all been foreknown and provided for in Jesus.</p>
