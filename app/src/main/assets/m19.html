<p id="d0319am-p3">Christian, take good care of thy faith; for recollect <em>faith </em><em>is the only way whereby thou canst obtain blessings</em>. If we want blessings from God, nothing can fetch them down but faith. Prayer cannot draw down answers from God&rsquo;s throne except it be the earnest prayer of the man who believes. Faith is the angelic messenger between the soul and the Lord Jesus in glory. Let that angel be withdrawn, we can neither send up prayer, nor receive the answers. Faith is the telegraphic wire which links earth and heaven—on which God&rsquo;s messages of love fly so fast, that before we call he answers, and while we are yet speaking he hears us. But if that telegraphic wire of faith be snapped, how can we receive the promise? Am I in trouble?—I can obtain help for trouble by faith. Am I beaten about by the enemy?—my soul on her dear Refuge leans by faith. But take faith away—in vain I call to God. There is no road betwixt my soul and heaven. In the deepest wintertime faith is a road on which the horses of prayer may travel—aye, and all the better for the biting frost; but blockade the road, and how can we communicate with the Great King? Faith links me with divinity. Faith clothes me with the power of God. Faith engages on my side the omnipotence of Jehovah. Faith ensures every attribute of God in my defence. It helps me to defy the hosts of hell. It makes me march triumphant over the necks of my enemies. But without faith how can I receive anything of the Lord? Let not him that wavereth—who is like a wave of the Sea—expect that he will receive anything of God! O, then, Christian, watch well thy faith; for with it thou canst win all things, however poor thou art, but without it thou canst obtain nothing. &ldquo;If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0319pm-p3">Whenever we are privileged to eat of the bread which Jesus gives, we are, like Ruth, satisfied with the full and sweet repast. When Jesus is the host, no guest goes empty from the table. Our <em>head</em> is satisfied with the precious truth which Christ reveals; our <em>heart</em> is content with Jesus, as the altogether lovely object of affection; our <em>hope</em> is satisfied, for whom have we in heaven but Jesus? and our desire is satiated, for what can we wish for more than &ldquo;to know Christ and to be found in him?&rdquo; Jesus fills our <em>conscience</em> till it is at perfect peace; our <em>judgment</em> with persuasion of the certainty of his teachings; our <em>memory</em> with recollections of what he has done, and our <em>imagination</em> with the prospects of what he is yet to do. As Ruth was &ldquo;sufficed, <em>and left</em>,&rdquo; so is it with us. We have had deep draughts; we have thought that we could take in all of Christ; but when we have done our best we have had to leave a vast remainder. We have sat at the table of the Lord&rsquo;s love, and said, &ldquo;Nothing but the infinite can ever satisfy me; I am such a great sinner that I must have infinite merit to wash my sin away;&rdquo; but we have had our sin removed, and found that there was merit to spare; we have had our hunger relieved at the feast of sacred love, and found that there was a redundance of spiritual meat remaining. There are certain sweet things in the Word of God which we have not enjoyed yet, and which we are obliged to leave for awhile; for we are like the disciples to whom Jesus said, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&rdquo; Yes, there are graces to which we have not attained; places of fellowship nearer to Christ which we have not reached; and heights of communion which our feet have not climbed. At every banquet of love there are many baskets of fragments left. Let us magnify the liberality of our glorious Boaz.</p>
