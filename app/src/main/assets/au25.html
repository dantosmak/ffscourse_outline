<p id="d0825am-p3">Faith, in the Scripture, is spoken of under the emblem of all the senses. It is <em>sight</em>: &ldquo;Look unto me and be ye saved.&rdquo; It is <em>hearing</em>: &ldquo;Hear, and your soul shall live.&rdquo; Faith is <em>smelling</em>: &ldquo;All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia&rdquo;; &ldquo;thy name is as ointment poured forth.&rdquo; Faith is spiritual <em>touch</em>. By this faith the woman came behind and touched the hem of Christ&rsquo;s garment, and by this we handle the things of the good word of life. Faith is equally the spirit&rsquo;s taste. &ldquo;How sweet are thy words to my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my lips.&rdquo; &ldquo;Except a man eat my flesh,&rdquo; saith Christ, <em>&ldquo;and drink my blood, there is no life in him.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p id="d0825am-p4">This &ldquo;<em>taste</em>&rdquo; is faith <em>in one of its highest </em><em>operations</em>. One of the first performances of faith is <em>hearing</em>. We hear the voice of God, not with the outward ear alone, but with the inward ear; we hear it as God&rsquo;s Word, and we believe it to be so; that is the &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; of faith. Then our mind <em>looketh</em> upon the truth as it is presented to us; that is to say, we understand it, we perceive its meaning; that is the &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; of faith. Next we discover its preciousness; we begin to admire it, and find how fragrant it is; that is faith in its &ldquo;<em>smell</em>.&rdquo; Then we appropriate the mercies which are prepared for us in Christ; that is faith in its &ldquo;<em>touch</em>.&rdquo; Hence follow the enjoyments, peace, delight, communion; which are faith in its &ldquo;taste.&rdquo; Any one of these acts of faith is saving. To hear Christ&rsquo;s voice as the sure voice of God in the soul will save us; but that which gives true enjoyment is the aspect of faith wherein Christ, by holy taste, is received into us, and made, by inward and spiritual apprehension of his sweetness and preciousness, to be the food of our souls. It is then we sit &ldquo;under his shadow with great delight,&rdquo; and find his fruit sweet to our taste.</p>

<p id="d0825pm-p3">These words may answer your scruples, devout reader, concerning <em>the ordinances</em>. Perhaps you say, &ldquo;I should be afraid to be baptized; it is such a solemn thing to avow myself to be dead with Christ, and buried with him. I should not feel at liberty to come to the Master&rsquo;s table; I should be afraid of eating and drinking damnation unto myself, not discerning the Lord&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; Ah! poor trembler, Jesus has given you liberty, be not afraid. If a stranger came to your house, he would stand at the door, or wait in the hall; he would not dream of intruding unbidden into your parlour—he is not at home: but your child makes himself very free about the house; and so is it with the child of God. A stranger may not intrude where a child may venture. When the Holy Ghost has given you to feel the spirit of adoption, you may come to Christian ordinances without fear. The same rule holds good of the <em>Christian&rsquo;s inward privileges</em>. You think, poor seeker, that you are not allowed to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory; if you are permitted to get inside Christ&rsquo;s door, or sit at the bottom of his table, you will be well content. Ah! but you shall not have less privileges than the very greatest. God makes no difference in his love to his children. A child is a child to him; he will not make him a hired servant; but he shall feast upon the fatted calf, and shall have the music and the dancing as much as if he had never gone astray. When Jesus comes into the heart, he issues a general licence to be glad in the Lord. No chains are worn in the court of King Jesus. Our admission into full privileges may be gradual, but it is sure. Perhaps our reader is saying, &ldquo;I wish I could enjoy the promises, and walk at liberty in my Lord&rsquo;s commands.&rdquo; &ldquo;If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.&rdquo; Loose the chains of thy neck, O captive daughter, for Jesus makes thee free.</p>
