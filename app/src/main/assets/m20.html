<p id="d0320am-p3">This was a golden name which the ancient Church in her most joyous moments was wont to give to the Anointed of the Lord. When the time of the singing of birds was come, and the voice of the turtle was heard in her land, <em>her</em> love-note was sweeter than either, as she sang, &ldquo;<em>My beloved</em> is mine and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.&rdquo; Ever in her song of songs doth she call him by that delightful name, &ldquo;My beloved!&rdquo; Even in the long winter, when idolatry had withered the garden of the Lord, her prophets found space to lay aside the burden of the Lord for a little season, and to say, as Esaias did, &ldquo;Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.&rdquo; Though the saints had never seen his face, though as yet he was not made flesh, nor had dwelt among us, nor had man beheld his glory, yet he was the consolation of Israel, the hope and joy of all the chosen, the &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; of all those who were upright before the Most High. We, in the summer days of the Church, are also wont to speak of Christ as the best beloved of our soul, and to feel that he is very precious, the &ldquo;chiefest among ten thousand, and the altogether lovely.&rdquo; So true is it that the Church loves Jesus, and claims him as her beloved, that the apostle dares to defy the whole universe to separate her from the love of Christ, and declares that neither persecutions, distress, affliction, peril, or the sword have been able to do it; nay, he joyously boasts, &ldquo;In all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="d0320pm-p3">What a golden example Christ gives to his disciples! Few masters could venture to say, &ldquo;If you would practise my teaching, imitate my life;&rdquo; but as the life of Jesus is the exact transcript of perfect virtue, he can point to himself as the paragon of holiness, as well as the teacher of it. The Christian should take nothing short of Christ for his model. Under no circumstances ought we to be content unless we reflect the grace which was in him. As a husband, the Christian is to look upon the portrait of Christ Jesus, and he is to paint according to that copy. The true Christian is to be such a husband as Christ was to his church. The love of a husband is <em>special</em>. The Lord Jesus cherishes for the church a peculiar affection, which is set upon her above the rest of mankind: &ldquo;I pray for them, I pray not for the world.&rdquo; The elect church is the favourite of heaven, the treasure of Christ, the crown of his head, the bracelet of his arm, the breastplate of his heart, the very centre and core of his love. A husband should love his wife with a <em>constant</em> love, for thus Jesus loves his church. He does not vary in his affection. He may change in his display of affection, but the affection itself is still the same. A husband should love his wife with an <em>enduring</em> love, for nothing &ldquo;shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo; A true husband loves his wife with a <em>hearty</em> love, fervent and intense. It is not mere lip-service. Ah! beloved, what more could Christ have done in proof of his love than he has done? Jesus has a <em>delighted </em><em>love</em> towards his spouse: He prizes her affection, and delights in her with sweet complacence. Believer, you wonder at Jesus&rsquo; love; you admire it—<em>are you imitating it</em>? In your domestic relationships is the rule and measure of your love—&ldquo;<em>even as Christ loved the church</em>?&rdquo;</p>
