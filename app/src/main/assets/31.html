<p id="d0131am-p3">It will always give a Christian the greatest calm, quiet, ease, and peace, to think of the perfect righteousness of Christ. How often are the saints of God downcast and sad! I do not think they ought to be. I do not think they would if they could always see their perfection in Christ. There are some who are always talking about corruption, and the depravity of the heart, and the innate evil of the soul. This is quite true, but why not go a little further, and remember that we are &ldquo;perfect in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; It is no wonder that those who are dwelling upon their own corruption should wear such downcast looks; but surely if we call to mind that &ldquo;Christ is made unto us righteousness,&rdquo; we shall be of good cheer. What though distresses afflict me, though Satan assault me, though there may be many things to be experienced before I get to heaven, those are done for me in the covenant of divine grace; there is nothing wanting in my Lord, Christ hath done it all. On the cross he said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; and if it be finished, then am I complete in him, and can rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, &ldquo;Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.&rdquo; You will not find on this side heaven a holier people than those who receive into their hearts the doctrine of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness. When the believer says, &ldquo;I live on Christ alone; I rest on him solely for salvation; and I believe that, however unworthy, I am still saved in Jesus;&rdquo; then there rises up as a motive of gratitude this thoughtâ€”&ldquo;Shall I not live to Christ? Shall I not love him and serve him, seeing that I am saved by his merits?&rdquo; &ldquo;The love of Christ constraineth us,&rdquo; &ldquo;that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them.&rdquo; If saved by imputed righteousness, we shall greatly value imparted righteousness.</p>

<p id="d0131pm-p3">Running is not everything, there is much in the way which we select: a swift foot over hill and down dale will not keep pace with a slower traveller upon level ground. How is it with my spiritual journey, am I labouring up the hill of my own works and down into the ravines of my own humiliations and resolutions, or do I run by the plain way of &ldquo;Believe and live&rdquo;? How blessed is it to wait upon the Lord by faith! The soul runs without weariness, and walks without fainting, in the way of believing. Christ Jesus is the way of life, and he is a plain way, a pleasant way, a way suitable for the tottering feet and feeble knees of trembling sinners: am I found in this way, or am I hunting after another track such as priestcraft or metaphysics may promise me? I read of the way of holiness, that the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err therein: have I been delivered from proud reason and been brought as a little child to rest in Jesus&rsquo; love and blood? If so, by God&rsquo;s grace I shall outrun the strongest runner who chooses any other path. This truth I may remember to my profit in my daily cares and needs. It will be my wisest course to go at once to my God, and not to wander in a roundabout manner to this friend and that. He knows my wants and can relieve them, to whom should I repair but to himself by the direct appeal of prayer, and the plain argument of the promise. &ldquo;Straightforward makes the best runner.&rdquo; I will not parlay with the servants, but hasten to their master.</p>
<p id="d0131pm-p4">In reading this passage, it strikes me that if men vie with each other in common matters, and one outruns the other, I ought to be in solemn earnestness so to run that I may obtain. Lord, help me to gird up the loins of my mind, and may I press forward towards the mark for the prize of my high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
