                    "<p class=\"Hello\">Death, poverty, sickness, oppression, curse etc. all came as  a result of sin ; in other words, they were the consequences of sin. Salvation  means to be delivered from sin and its consequences. This understanding of  salvation suggests to us that salvation is all encompassing. It means  deliverance, safety, preservation, healing and soundness.</p>\n" +
                    "<h3 class=\"Hello\">MAN</h3>\n" +
                    "<p class=\"Hello\">Man is a spirit, he has a soul and he lives in the body (1  Thess 5:23). With the spirit, man accesses the spiritual realm, with the soul,  he accesses the intellectual realm, and with the body, he accesses the physical  realm. The soul, which is a possession of the spirit, has three core aspects  namely the will, the emotion and the mind. <br />\n" +
                    "  Man expresses his possession of a will in his ability to  make choices based on his own judgment. Happiness and sadness are expressions  of the emotion. The mind, which is the seat of the consciousness/awareness of  man, houses the intellectual capacity of his soul.</p>\n" +
                    "<h3 class=\"Hello\">WHY SALVATION?</h3>\n" +
                    "<p class=\"Hello\">Adam, the first man God made, represented the entire human  race for God had commanded him to fill the earth (Gen 1:28). He sinned in the Garden  of Eden by eating the fruit God had commanded him not to eat (Gen 2:16-17, Gen  3:6-7). This was a deliberate exercise of his will against God&rsquo;s order not a  mistake (1 Tim 2:14); as a result, his spirit became separated from God i.e. he  instantly died spiritually (Gen 2:17). Hecould no longer fellowship with God  (John 4:24) neither could he access the spiritual realm. Consequently, the  primary source of information for the awareness of his soul changed from the  spirit realm to the physical realm.&nbsp; (Compare  Gen 2:25 with Gen 3:7&amp; 10).<br />\n" +
                    "  By reason of the treason, Satan became his father (John  8:44, Eph 2:3). Also, he lost his dominion over all the works of God to the  devil (Gen 1:26-27). Do not forget, Lucifer was expelled from heaven to the  earth because he wanted for himself God&rsquo;s authority (Isa 14:12-14). He missed  it; however, by his craftiness;he got man&rsquo;s authority and became the god of  this world (2 Cor 4:4) in the place of man.<br />\n" +
                    "  His sin did not only affect his spirit; his mind became  corrupted by the information he was receiving from the physical realm (which is  Satan&rsquo;s domain &ndash; 2 Cor 4:4), so much so that every intent of the thought of his  heart was evil continually (Gen 6:5, Jer 17:7, Rom 1:29). <br />\n" +
                    "  Adam became subject to poverty, sickness, oppression, and  struggle (Gen 3:17-19). His physical body became subject to death (Gen 5:5).<br />\n" +
                    "  The whole world became partakers of the consequences of  Adam&rsquo;s sin because he represented the entire human race (Rom 5:18-19). </p>\n" +
                    "<span class=\"Hello\"><br clear=\"all\" />\n" +
                    "</span>\n" +
                    "<p class=\"Hello\">However, God in His  infinite mercy, for the sake of the love wherewith He loved us, sent Jesus, the  second Adam to become sin in our place (2 Cor 5:21, Rom 5:8), so that anyone  who believes in Him should not perish but should have the life of God - ZOE  (John 3:16). This means at salvation, God replaces the dead spirit with a new  one (2 Cor 5:17).<br />\n" +
                    "  The soul, which had become totally corrupted through its  interaction with earthly things, is saved as we consistently set our minds on  things above (Col 3:2) or according to James 1:21 receive with meekness the  engrafted word. The process by which we set our minds on things above/receive  with meekness the engrafted word is MEDITATION. The mind is renewed as we  meditate on God&rsquo;s Word; that&rsquo;s why Ps 19:7 says God&rsquo;s Word is able to convert  the soul (i.e. from depravity to rectitude). &ldquo;Renewing the mind&rdquo; is not  something that is done once; we have to keep at it for as long as we live on  the earth.<br />\n" +
                    "  Our death doomed body will be changed to an immortal body at  the appearing of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor 15:52-54, 2 Cor 5:4).</p>\n" +
                    "<h3 class=\"Hello\">HOW DOES A MAN GET SAVED?</h3>\n" +
                    "<p class=\"Hello\">The scriptures reveal to us that Salvation is purely a  provision of Grace and man takes delivery of it by Faith (Eph 2:8). Anyone who  confesses Jesus as his Lord and believes in his heart that God raised him from  the dead automatically is saved. (Rom 10:8-10).<br />\n" +
                    "  Salvation is not something a man can delay till tomorrow;  the scripture declares that NOW is the time for salvation (2Cor 6:2).</p>\n" +

To be filled with the Holy Spirit means to be  completely taken over by the Holy Spirit. It is easy to understand when you  consider someone who is drunk with alcohol; such a person acts under the influence  of the alcohol. So also, a man who is filled with the spirit acts under the  influence of the Holy Spirit. Speaking in tongues is an initial evidence of the  infilling of the Holy Spirit. There are five instances recorded in the Bible  where believers received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and &ldquo;tongues&rdquo; was an  accompanying sign in all of those instances. (Acts 2:4; Acts 10:44-46; Acts  19:1-6; Acts 9:17 &amp; 1 Cor. 14:18; Acts 8:14-20 &ndash; Simon saw something).<br />\n" +

                    "<p>There is a striking similarity between spiritual  growth and physical growth. Every Christian is born a babe, but God does not  want any Christian to remain a babe; He desires for us to develop spiritually  to the point where we reach a mature manhood (Eph 4:13 AMP). Just like physical  growth requires physical food, spiritual growth requires spiritual food.  Spiritual growth is reflected in a believer&rsquo;s knowledge, use, and practice of  God&rsquo;s Word; it is not a function of age.</p>\n" +

                    "  The babe in Christ cannot take advantage of certain  kingdom privileges and inheritances. Just like no natural father would commit  sensitive matters to be handled by his 5yr old child, our heavenly Father does  not commit important responsibilities in the kingdom to be handled by children  because He knows they will make a mess of it.</p>\n" +

In this  discourse, the babyhood and childhood stages are considered under category &ndash;  &ldquo;immature believers&rdquo;, while the manhood stage is considered under the category  &ldquo;mature believers&rdquo;<br />\n" +
                    "  A Christian can be a babe either by virtue of new  birth (e.g. 1 Pet. 2:2) or because he is not growing as he ought to grow  (Heb5:12). The hallmark of spiritual immaturity is <strong>carnality</strong> while that of spiritual maturity is <strong>spirituality</strong> (1 Cor. 3:1-4).<br />\n" +
                    "  To be carnal means to be sense ruled i.e. to be  governed by the flesh. Carnal believers walk like unbelievers. Carnality is in  varying degrees; its manifestations include envy, jealousy, strife, divisions,  etc. Christians, who criticize other believers, quarrel over scriptures, answer  altar calls repeatedly, speak evil of others are carnal. In the world today, it  is not uncommon to find Christians who believe they don&rsquo;t have to go to Church  as long as they are worshipping God at home, such believers are carnal.<br />\n" +
                    "  The spiritual man on the other hand is that man who  is well schooled in the knowledge and practice of God&rsquo;s word i.e. his life is  governed by the word of God; he knows what belongs to him in Christ and takes  advantage of it. Love is a prominent feature of spirituality. All the  characteristics of love recorded in 1 Cor. 13:4-7are manifestations of  spirituality.

                    "<p>1 John 2: 10 says that whoever walks in love lives in the  light and there is nothing to make him stumble. Thus, the way to walk safely is  to walk in love.

So not to walk in love is  to give place to the devil (Eph 4:26-27).

                    "<p>Four  times in the Bible, we find the expression &ldquo;the just shall live by faith&rdquo; (Hab.  2:4, Rom. 1:17, Gal. 3:11, Heb. 10:38). Faith is the way of life of a Just.  Faith is not optional to believer because without it, it is impossible to  please God. (Heb. 11:6) Patriarchs in the Old Testament were distinguished and  set above the crowd by their acts of faith. (Heb. 11) </p>\n" +
                    "<h3>WHAT IS FAITH?</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>Faith  is defined in several different ways &ndash; all reflecting either directly or  indirectly that it is dependent on God&rsquo;s word. Heb. 11:1 defines faith as the  substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Faith is the  confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen, physical sign  notwithstanding. This assurance comes from God&rsquo;s word. <strong>Any kind of assurance that is not based on the Word of God is  presumption, not faith. </strong>Faith is simply believing the word of God- taking  the Word at its face value.</p>\n" +
                    "<h3>WHAT FAITH IS NOT</h3>\n" +
                    "<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n" +
                    "  <li>Faith is not presumption or assumption. Any kind of       assurance that is not based on the word of God is not faith.<strong></strong></li>\n" +
                    "  <li>Faith is not of the head. The bible says with the heart       man believes (Rom 10:10). Head faith (or mental assent) is merely       accepting that what God has said is true without letting it control your       actions. For example it is possible to mentally agree with Mark 11:24 (<em>which says &ldquo;therefore I say to you,       whatever things you ask when you pray believe that believe that you       receive them, and you shall have them, and you will have them&rdquo;</em>) yet       still be worried about something you have taken to the Lord in prayer-       that is mental assent, not faith.<strong></strong></li>\n" +
                    "  <li>Faith is not based on human ideas or philosophies for       example &ldquo;in every dark cloud there is silver lining&rdquo;, &rdquo;after every dark       tunnel there is always light&rdquo;. Any assurance that is not based on the Word       of God is not faith.<strong></strong></li>\n" +
                    "  <li>Faith is not something you do by trial and error, you are       either in faith or out of faith.<strong></strong></li>\n" +
                    "  <li>Faith does not deny physical facts; rather, it       overrides them by the authority of the Word of God. For example faith for       healing is not saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick&rdquo; Instead it says &ldquo;I am healed&rdquo; because       God&rsquo;s word says so (1 Peter 2:24). Notice in Rom.4:17 that God does not       call those things that exist as though they did not; rather, He calls       those things which do not exist as though they did<strong></strong></li>\n" +

                    "<h3>HOW FAITH WORKS</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>By  faith, we understand that the world were framed by the word of God (Heb.11:3).  You can as well create the things you desire using the Word of God.<br />\n" +
                    "  Faith  comes by hearing the Word of God (Rom.10:17); so you need to <strong>find the scripture </strong>that assures you  that God has given you what you desire (e.g. health &ndash; 1Peter 1:2; provision  Ps.23:1), <strong>meditate on it </strong>till you  believe so strongly &ndash; so much so that it become impossible for you to think  otherwise. Then <strong>keep confessing it&rsquo;s  yours (</strong>2Cor. 4:13) and<strong> give thanks  to God </strong>for it (Rom. 4:20). For faith to work, you have to <strong>supply corresponding actions </strong>to it  (James 2:17). For example, they believe God had conquered Jericho for them and  they march around the city&rsquo;s walls for seven days (Heb. 11:30). Remember, faith  without corresponding action is a mental assent, and it will not work.<br />\n" +
                    "  The  fight of faith involves laying hold on God&rsquo;s word relentlessly (1 Tim. 6:12,  John 6:63b). The happening in the physical realm may look contrary to your  confessions, don&rsquo;t be discouraged. The Bible says believe, and therefore speak.  So keep confessing the Word and give thanks to God for what you believe you  have received. (Rom. 4:20).<br />\n" +
                    "  Faith  work by Love; so malice, hatred, unforgiveness will hinder faith (Gal. 5:6,  Mark 11:25).</p>\n" +

Believers often lose out on a lot of benefits either because they are  not praying the right way or they are not praying at all.

                    "<h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>After His resurrection, the Lord Jesus gave us a mandate to  reach the whole world with the gospel. The &ldquo;great commission&rdquo; we call it; it&rsquo;s  however amazing how many believers have relegated it to &ldquo;a great suggestion&rdquo;.  Evangelism is not one of those things we can do at leisure; it&rsquo;s a duty that  demands utmost urgency. Jesus said, &quot;No procrastination. No backward  looks. You can't put God's kingdom off till tomorrow. Seize the day.&quot; (Lk.  9:62 MSG).<br />\n" +
                    "  <strong>Evangelism  is communicating the gospel (or good news) in such a way that individuals are  presented with a valid opportunity to accept Jesus as their Lord and become  members of the body of Christ.</strong><br />\n" +
                    "  There are three key players in the work of evangelism  namely; the messenger, the message, and the recipient of the message.</p>\n" +
                    "<h3>THE MESSENGER (Lk. 19:10 &amp; John 20:21; 2 Cor. 5:18)</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>We, the believers are the ones commissioned by the Lord to  spread the news of God&rsquo;s saving power and eternal plan for all mankind (Ps 67:2  TLB). 2 Cor. 5:18 calls us ministers of reconciliation because it&rsquo;s our  ministry to spread the news by which sinners are reconciled to God &ndash; every one  of us, not just the Missions subgroup. Mighty though they are; angels cannot  preach the good news; the preaching of the gospel is an exclusive preserve of  believers. Little wonder Cornelius had to send for Peter at the instruction of  an angel to hear words by which he and his household might be saved (Acts  11:13-14). The angel did not attempt to preach to him; no he cannot! We are  responsible for every unbeliever around us (Eze. 33:8). One of the reasons for  the baptism of the Holy Spirit is so that we might be effective witnesses unto  Christ. The Holy Spirit saw it when Jesus died for the world, He witnessed  Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. Thus we can tell of the death and resurrection of Jesus as  though it happened right before us because the Holy Spirit, who witnessed these  things, dwells in us (Acts 5:32). The same Holy Spirit is the One who convicts  the sinner of his sin and make him realize his need for salvation as we preach  the gospel. (John 16:7-11)</p>\n" +
                    "<h3>THE MESSAGE (Rom. 1:16-17)</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>No messenger can do the work of evangelism without a sound  understanding of the message. The message we preach is the &ldquo;Gospel of Christ&rdquo;  (Rom 1:16, Mark 1:1,, Rom 15:29, 2 Cor 4:4 etc.)<br />\n" +
                    "  The words &ldquo;evangel&rdquo; (which is the root word from which we  derive evangelism) and &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; have the same Greek origin &ndash; &ldquo;euaggellion&rdquo;  which means &ldquo;good news&rdquo;. To evangelize means to announce the good news. <br />\n" +
                    "  <strong>The  gospel of Christ (or the good news of Christ) is that news or message which  reveals the provisions of God in Christ Jesus for mankind. For example, it  reveals the righteousness of God (Rom 1:16-17).</strong><br />\n" +
                    "  The Bible declares that the gospel of Christ is the power of  God to save anyone who believes in it. &nbsp;Rom 10:9-10 says <em>&ldquo;. . . if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in  your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with  the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is  made unto salvation.&rdquo; </em><br />\n" +
                    "  Thus, the gospel of Christ, which is the power of God, is  simply Rom 10:9-10 in your mouth. In other words, Rom 10:9-10 in your mouth is  able to save anyone who believes it. It is unscriptural to tell a sinner to  confess his sins (the confession of sins is strictly for any Christian who has  committed any sin &ndash; 1 John 1:9). What a sinner needs to confess is the Lordship  of Jesus.&nbsp; Rom 10:13 says &quot;whoever  calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;&nbsp; </p>\n" +
                    "<h3>THE RECIPIENT </h3>\n" +
                    "<p>The recipient is the unbeliever to whom we preach the gospel  of Christ. Jesus Christ said &ldquo;The harvest truly is plenteous&rdquo; (Matt 9:37), so  we don&rsquo;t need too long a search to locate them. In His commissioning word,  Jesus sent the disciples first to those in their immediate environment (i.e.  Jerusalem) before sending them to Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the  earth (Acts 1:8). So, we are first sent to those within our sphere of contact  or influence &ndash; that means the recipients are closer than we often suppose &ndash; our  unsaved friends, relatives, bunk mates, roommates, next door neighbors etc. </p>\n" +
                    "<h3>THE APPROACH</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>We can do the work of evangelism by going out as a group on  designated days (i.e. mass evangelism), however, the emphasis in this discourse  is personal evangelism. Personal evangelism is just what the name reflects &ndash;  sharing the Gospel personally with individuals.&nbsp;  It can be done by verbal proclamation through preaching, teaching, and  witnessing. You can turn ordinary day to day conversations into opportunities  to share the gospel. Jesus had numerous instances where he did personal  evangelism by verbal proclamation e.g. Nicodemus (John 3:1-21), the Samaritan  women (John 4:5-42), Nathaniel (John 1:43-51).<br />\n" +
                    "  Another dimension to personal evangelism is &ldquo;evangelism by  attraction&rdquo;. This refers to winning souls through you manner of life i.e. the  way you conduct yourself. Jesus said in Matt 5:16 &ldquo;Let your light so shine  before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in  heaven.&rdquo; Evangelism by attraction is an important aid to verbal proclamation of  the gospel. 1 Pet 3:1-2 teaches that those who are not won by your preaching  would be won when they observe your chaste conduct and reverent life.<br />\n" +
                    "  We have also been equipped with supernatural ability to  preach the gospel not just with words but also with signs and wonders  following. We can lay hands on the sick and expect them to recover, drive out  demon spirits etc. using the name of Jesus. (Mark 16:15-18).<br />\n" +
                    "  The work of evangelism is not complete without follow up in  prayers, visitation, etc. Jesus said to make disciples of them (Matt 28:19).  Follow up is important to establish the new converts in the faith. Jesus had an  inspiring testimony in the work of follow up &ndash; He said &ldquo;I have lost none&rdquo; (John  18:9, 17:12).</p>\n" +
                    "<h3>GETTING SOMEONE SAVED</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>You definitely don&rsquo;t have to memorize every scripture on  salvation to be able to get someone saved. Just one or two that you have  mastered well would do the job. (Suggestions include Rom 10:8-10, John 1:12,  Eph 2:8).&nbsp; Below is a confession based on  Rom 10:8-10 that you will find useful.)<br />\n" +
                    "  <em>&ldquo;Lord God, I thank you for making me realize my need for  salvation today. I believe that you sent Jesus to die for me and you raised Him  for my sake. I accept Him as the Lord and Savior of my life. I thank you because  I am born again; I am saved in Jesus&rsquo; name.&rdquo;</em></p>\n" +
                    "<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>\n" +
                    "<p>Soul winning is a noble calling; the Bible says soul winners  will shine as stars forever (Dan. 12:3). If you&rsquo;re not winning souls, then you  are not doing anything because that is our principal responsibility on earth.</p>\n" +

Every service we  render unto the Lord will be tested with fire, to know what sort it is and  anyone whose works are burned up&nbsp; though  will be saved, he would lose his reward (1 Cor. 3:11-15).
